When making this picture collage my first thought was to incorporate both astrology and space with renaissance art. Both concepts fascinate me and I knew that combining the portraits and the statutes of the renaissance with the stars and planets would make an interesting pair. I choose to have the glitch look like a tv screen to make it seem as if this is “old news”. I also felt as if while making this I had to listen to Gustav Holst’s “The Planets Suite” which is collection of musical pieces that go through almost all of the solar system and give each planet an atmosphere musically. 

The three renaissance women represent the plant or the moon in their area. The woman on the left is the moon the woman on the right is Jupiter and the woman in the middle is Mars. The statue represents humanity as it begins to rise into space. I wanted to make Mars the forefront due to how relevant it has become in modern culture.
