# Hyperlink Narrative

Upload screenshots of the different webpages or the different sections of your Net Art assignment. Think of ways you can create a non-linear and interactive storytelling experience using HTML and CSS. Your website can include multiple pages, or even be one page with a long scroll. Include images, text, audio, video, and any element that can convey your concept and ideas.
