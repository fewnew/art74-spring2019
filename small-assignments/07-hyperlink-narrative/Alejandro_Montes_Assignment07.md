# Description

I decided to create an interactive story in which people could enter a website that will allow them to choose their future. On the main page they're given two options, one is a blue button that grants them money but with consequences and a red button which grants them health and happines, but with money problems. This is done to see how people think and how their mind functions, they will then be taken into a page depending on what they chose. 

Choosing the blue button leads you into a screen that's flashing in bright colors, with the phrase "Feeling Guilty?" being repeated over and over again. This is done to trap people without a way out so they can feel guilty for taking the money. The red button, on the other hand takes you to a page that has confetti as a way to celebrate that you're not selfish and are not interested in money. It then has an image of an Amazon Gift Card as a "prize" which links back to the main page.
