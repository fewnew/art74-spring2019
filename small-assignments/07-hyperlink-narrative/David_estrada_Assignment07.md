<H3> Description </H3>
<p>For this piece, I decided to create a net art installation. The piece displays a night sky view with some stars leading to different pages. The following pages contain gifs of skeletons doing certain actions. There isn't too much meaning behind this piece other than some stars redirecting the user to other pages with skeletons. I guess you can say that with each star that is clicked on, you can't quite predict what will happen or what's out there similar to us not knowing what's out there in space and what lives amongst the stars.
