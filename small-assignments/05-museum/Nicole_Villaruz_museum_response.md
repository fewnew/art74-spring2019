In the center of the exhibit is a large room that holds groups of rectangular sculptures spread 
across the space. These structures are covered in photographs and handwritten notes. They
are displayed in a net-like shape, so one is able to peer through the structures. It can be seen 
that there are photographs facing inwards. This art piece resonated with me because its large 
scale caught my attention. Up close, however, it becomes very intimate and personal with the 
photos and letters of people.
