I think this looks like a hummingbird or a duck in flight. It also kind of reminds me of a butterfly
Code:

void setup() {
  size(800, 800);
  background(355); }
  
void draw() {
  triangle(70, 75, 528, 220, 500, 750);
  quad(38, 31, 86, 20, 300, 630, 320, 76);
  quad(50, 67, 800, 20, 300, 430, 320, 76);}
