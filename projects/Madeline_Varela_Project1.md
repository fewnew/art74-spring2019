  ## Description
  ---
  I wanted the collage to have a feeling of being on vacation, with the use of color.
  I tried to keep my colors bright and vibrant, when you are walking in the downtown streets of aruba you can see a of these bright colors.
  The bright orange and red background in the collage is similar to the sunsets you see while you are in aruba
  This collage is more of a personal and a small conceptual motivation then a political motivation. 
  I really enjoyed being there and wanted others too see how fun this 20 mile island is.
  lastly with using the colors I chose, I want the audience to get a feel of the psycodelic summer vibe that revolves around the concept of summer.
  
  I hope that when the viewer looks at the collage, I want them to feel relaxed and worry-free like as if they were on vacation.
  The things that influenced me would have to be, ocean life and a ~~small~~ love for the beach.
