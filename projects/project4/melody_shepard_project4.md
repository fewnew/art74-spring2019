I have included the three projects I worked on during Art 74 and also some of my art from the last year. I am very new to HTML so designing and formatting is something that is very difficult for me to overcome due to my inexperience. I hope the text is easy to read for the descriptions of my projects.

I hope to eventually write a Statement of Purpose and have descriptions for all of the art I have chosen to showcase in my portfolio. I am also new to digital art and there are many unfinished works that I do not wish to include in my portfolio for now. I hope to polish up those works so I can feel more comfortable making those pieces of art public, but for now, this is all my portflio will include.
