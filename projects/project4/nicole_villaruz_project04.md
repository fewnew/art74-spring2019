## Project Description
 When I designed my website, I immediately knew that I wanted to tie together my ongoing theme of dreams that I incorporated into 
 the majority of the assignments and projects. I gave my website a simple aesthetic, both because it is a style that I enjoy, and
 because it was my first time coding.
