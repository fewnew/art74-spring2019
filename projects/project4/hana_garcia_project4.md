Description:
Forn my portfolio I really wanted to create something simple yet eye catching. My backgrounds for all the pages of my portfolio are made by me using the threejsplaynd site. I used buttons to link to the other projects. I feel that my backgrounds remind me of Tron. This was one of the hardest assignments I’ve done but I’m so proud of how it turned out.
