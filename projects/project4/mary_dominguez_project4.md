## Website

https://mmarydom.github.io/index.html

This website features the projects I worked on throughout the semester in this class. THe overrall theme is a cutesy bloglike website - a stark contrast to most of the themes I presented in my projects. I was experimenting with this website as I was learning HTML, so I just chose a random aesthetic.
After making this website, I realized I wanted to make a more technology vs. nature theme, but I had no time to make further changes.

I originally had no plan or idea on how to make this blog-like website, but as I learned more about HTML I began to picture what I wanted. A few of the code I added I learned mostly from W3schools, such as the display menu and the split boxes. But soon I was able to pick up the language and figured out how to edit it by myself. I found it very fun making this website and it was alot easier than I expected when I learned more about HTML on my free time.
