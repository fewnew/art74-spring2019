# Description

For my portfolio I wanted to create something simple, something that was straight forward and professional. I got a template from W3Schools.com and decided to keep the white background, I added my logo, my name, a picture of myself, etc. I linked my three projects I've done so far in this class, each on different pages. Within those pages I added buttons allowing you to go to the next or previous page. To give it an artistic and creative touch I added two gifs, one behind my portfolio section and the other on each of my pages that show my projects. The gifs are both related to the theme of most of my artworks, which have to do with roman, greek, and classical art. The outcome was a simple, yet personal website in which my projects are presented in a professional style.
