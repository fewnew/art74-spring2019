 for my portfolio i wanted to do something simple and straight to the point of the assignment. for my background it was supposed to be a pastel pink with color changing specs however for some reason i could not get it to show on the website itself, although it does work when opened on my desktop. the background wouldve tied the whole website together as right now it does not look like much. i linked the pages to my projects ive done this semester, each on their own page of my website. and although i did have some technical issues with the background, all the liniks are working and lead you to the right pages, which mattered the most to me as it fills the requirements for this project.
