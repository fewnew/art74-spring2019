# Description

Welcome to my website, I wanted to make a website that is eye catching yet simple enough for people to navigate through. With the use of atom as well as w3schools, I was able to produce my first website and I am excited to make more.

The website includes all of the work that was done this sumester of Spring 2019. My artwork often takes the theme of supernatural or unknown, so I stuck with colors that would make the website seem dark. I also included an animation of a black cat, which is representational of a bad omen, relating back to the supernatural or superstition.
