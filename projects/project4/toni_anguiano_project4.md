### Project Description

This portfolio site is a collection of all the digital pieces I have created throughout
the past semester. It is also a collection of all the new things I have learned and new
skills I have under my belt as a digital artist and simply an artist as a whole. I am 
proud of the pieces cradled within the website I have carefully coded and though the 
layout is quite plain, I am rpoud of it nonetheless because this was my first ever
experience creating a site from scratch. This project has taught me to better understand
the process of coding and how to create links to different webpages and how to work
with css and javascript.
