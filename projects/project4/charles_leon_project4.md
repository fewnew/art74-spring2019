This was the first time I have compiled all of my work into a full fleshed-out portfolio so I added a few more projects to the website accordingly. I wanted to keep a clean consistent and simple look to my site so I ended up creating images that served as buttons to link to the other pages in Photoshop and I really liked the simplicity of the black on white and thus decided to keep that on the other pages, but with a little twist of adding a preview of the work within the buttons. I made the pages that held my projects pretty simple as well, titles at the top, work made to fit the width of the screen and then documentation or rationale under them if I had them (not included in one photo series and a photo collection). It was really surprising to see the website actually work slightly better on mobile platforms when all was said and done, and I definitely would like to keep this portfolio updated in the future or even improve on it by further learning html and css.
