### **Project Description**
***
This website is a documentation of my artwork from the semester. Even the website itself is like art as it is customizeable to each individual's tastes and style.

I kept my website simple, but clean. As a graphic design major I chose a sans-serif font and kept the hierarchy between text simple through type size. I also paid tribute to all the printing I've done in my graphic design classes through the CMY background. In print media the inks are cyan, yellow, and magenta. They are bright colors and can be overwhelming so I turned down the opacity so that they wouldn't clash with the text.
