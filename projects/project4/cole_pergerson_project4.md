This site contains projects the that I completed in Art74 for the spring semester of 2019. I've also included Horizon Dream, my game that I will be releasing in the summer.

I starting web programming only a few months ago and I'm already creating some sick ThreeJS visuals! Working with ThreeJS allows me to create easily accessible graphical projects, although, getting started wasn't easy. The documentation doesn't provide me a complete understanding of ThreeJS and at times, is missing useful information. With that said, I still enjoy working with ThreeJS and the lack of documentation makes solving bugs all the more awarding.
