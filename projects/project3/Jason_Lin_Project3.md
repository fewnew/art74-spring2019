# Project Description

My project is called "Diving Into Your Fears", and it consists of a deadly spider ridden by death, in which any normal person would fear. Mostly everyone has their phobias, and in my case it's spiders. The eight legged creepy crawlies, linger throughout everyones household and creep onto you unexpectantly. 

My 3D model includes a freakishly large spider the size of a house and wears the skulls of those it has reaped, an exaggeration of how terrifying spiders are to me. Incoming from sky is a man diving into the ferocious spider, which is representational of overcoming your fears by facing them head on, something that I hope to accomplish one day.
