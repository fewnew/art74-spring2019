## Description

To begin with, I've always been a fan of the color purple and I wanted to work with a floral theme because 3D environments really fascinate me. I played around with shapes and lines before I began to add additional 3D models I found on Turbosquid. I played around with organic shapes to contrast with the geometric shapes of the tree. I wanted the figures to intertwine as a composition because from the roots, everything is connected in nature
