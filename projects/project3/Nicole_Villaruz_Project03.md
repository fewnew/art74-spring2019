## Project Description
 I initially started this project while experimenting on Sketchfab, where I manipulated a 3D object. The results of my experimentation 
 made the final product resemble shattering roses. I was inspired both by the appearance of this 3D model and the theme of my piece for 
 Project 1. 
 
 The rose motif in these projects made me think of romance and love. With using Meshmixer, I tried to find objects that symbolized my 
 chosen theme. Things like hearts, roses, vines, and the tree, when thrown together portray a garden. The hearts growing on trees, and the
 oversized rose bushes add an extra dreaminess to the piece, which can relate back to the same feelings emanated from Project 1. I also 
 used a similar color scheme by picking a light dusty pink color.
