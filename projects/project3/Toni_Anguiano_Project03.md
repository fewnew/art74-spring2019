### Description

A bright colored candy plane is luring in monsters and consuming them. I created this<b>
piece for the humor of it rather than anything serious or meaningful. I wanted this 3D<b>
model to be light-hearted and fun to observe. Its a giant piece of something resembling<b>
that of taffy pulling a weird, creature with various animals parts and a scary vampire bat<b> 
into a blinding baby-blue, purplish pink plane. Goopy arms reaching out of the ground like<b> 
a venus flytrap as the monsters try to resist. My audience will be met with a funny image<b> 
but perhaps not realize the dark undertones of what they are seeing. I was inspired by the<b>
Coraline created by Laika Films. Specifically the scene when the creepy circus sisters turn<b>
into a piece of candy. The colors caught my eye in the film and I never forgot them. As<b>
always, I wanted my piece to be creepy or odd but I wanted it to be fun.<b>
