I wanted to create a fantasy of a room/closet gone completely chaotic and messy. My inspiration was my own room, but much worse. I let my imagination go and thought what elements could I bring to the scene to maintain a sense of reality and fantasy.

I built the scene off of a hanger object from Poly. I took the hangers, morphed them, and put them on a hill of this goo. I added a hand poking out of the goo to give the scene a sense of impending danger. The door, behind the viewer in VR, is made to be smaller than the viewer and imply there is no possibility of escape.
