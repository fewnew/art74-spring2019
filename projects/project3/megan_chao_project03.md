# Project Description
Zoo was based around fantasylands with creatures that are often morphed or mixed with other creatures in fairytale stories. The color value on the creatures are very simple and they all follow a basic theme of flat color with a wash of other colors on them. The left is a gorilla morphed into a sphere, the middle includes a dragon with hands coming out of the side, and the right shows a goose morphed into a cube. 

I thought including a whimsical theme would make the viewers remininse of their childhood and have them relate to stories they might have heard when they were younger. Tales such as "Narnia" or "Percy Jackson" and the creatures seen in those tales is a big inspiration to how I decided to create my project.
