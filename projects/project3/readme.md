# Project 03: 3D MeshMash
### :three: (remix) 

Using three objects/forms that are from both existing and found (downloaded from the internet) sources, mix together a virtual 3D sculpture using Meshmixer. Design the impossible! Your mashup may be an exciting re-interpretation of a classic form or even a chaotic mess made of organic and/or geometric designs. You are also required to visualize the purpose and "story" behind the objects that you choose to model. The final work must be submitted to https://sketchfab.com/
