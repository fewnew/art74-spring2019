The main idea behind this model was that of a small environment evoking the familiar feeling of a video game, more specifically areas known as Boss Arena’s. Originally I wanted to create an environment with various floating islands each having something atop them, whether that be generic vegetation or various original creations. However I liked the idea of just having the objects float around a central platform as is seen with the pillars high above the center island and smaller rocks forming a circle around it and the other islands. It was at this point where I thought of my scene as one of these Boss Battles and imported a simple head and made it larger compared to the platform to create that type of scene. I really enjoyed exploring this idea once viewing it from the VR perspective in Sketchfab, where the face and objects where at a large scale compared to the person viewing. I also went with the idea of the scene being in the middle of one of these Boss Battles and deleted some of the face to indicate damage and moved the pillars to above the viewpoint to show the scene is during one of the Boss’s attacks.
