### **Project Description**
***

Right off the bat you’re hit with pink. A lot of pink. As you zoom in closer you notice the pink has forms to it, flowers, more plants, and cats with wings? The piece is meant to feel magical, fantasy-like, nothing deeper than that. I’ve recreated the themes that I loved drawing and doodling as a kid into a 3D setting. 

This is a reinterpretation of the environments I would imagine and draw when I was a kid. I was heavily influenced by my large book of five minute fairy tales that I was gifted in the year 2000, which I still own to this day. I love the stories, the magic, and the illustrations and was inspired by that fun and magical feel these stories gave. 

This piece has no serious meaning or commentary unlike my previous works. Around the same time of my life when I received my large book of fairy tales I realized that I liked art, a lot. I liked drawing and creating more than any other activity a little kid does, and I knew that this part of me was special. I wasn’t afraid to draw what I liked, experiment with colors and subjects, as a kid you just don’t care about those things. This is what made being a kid more fun. 

I guess the artist that inspired me for this piece was my four year old self. The artistic side of me today and me back then are way different. My pieces today are fleshed out with thought, but I also realize sometimes I’m not having fun. My art needed to be good, it needed to be deep, and I constantly needed to improve. I decided with a new platform of art that I am completely unfamiliar with I would press the restart button. I wanted to view this piece like I would if I was four year old me. I wanted to explore my options, explore my tools, and not care about the overall meaning. I just wanted to make something fun and something I enjoyed.
