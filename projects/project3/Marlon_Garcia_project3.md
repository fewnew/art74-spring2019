<h2>Description</h2>
<p>For this project I focus myself in getting trying to add objects into the skull, Ive always been a fan of skull and roses tattoos, I wanted to recreated something I would like tat myself in the future. I also tried to create something abstract because sometimes it just works out perfectly.
