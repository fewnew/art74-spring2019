My first 3D anything! For this project, as we meshed things together to create imaginary worlds and objects and scenes, I created my ideal vacation spot. Here, on an island of rocky texture, with a shiny green/grey glow, dotted with shady palms and adorned with a beautiful set of drums, I find some peace and quiet that I can disturb on my own terms. Large enough for a small group of friends to elope by my side and comfortable enough to be shaded from the sun on this vatation, this island provies a private musical getaway for those who take advantage of it. Using 3D models on _TurboSquid_, I edited and pieced them together in Meshmixer. Then as one .obj file, I added a glossy green finish in Sketchfab to tie the whole thing together. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the music.
