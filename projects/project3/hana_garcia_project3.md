Project Description
This 3d Scuplture was meant to make the viewer feel uneasy. Whether it be the spikes that seems to be coming at you, the chaotic 
unorganized style, or the skull stationed at the base of the "tree" it's meant ot be unsettling. The process of making this sculpture 
was so interesting I had never really interacted with VR before this aside from 1am session playing BeatSaber in an Oculus with my 
friends. The thing that I had trouble with the most was just getting used to imagining something in a 3D sense and getting used to Meshmixer
in general. I got this idea for uneasy by listening to a podcast and them mentioning sleep paralysis and how for some people they see monsters
this idea fastenated me. A scary thing created from your mind. The things being described didn't even have tobe scary they just caused the 
person suffering from sleep paralysis to feel uneasy and thats where my idea came from.
