Make an animated gif. Harness your skills to create a more elaborate animation or a cinematographic style gif. Just use your imagination and create a complicated animation based on a narrative. Make sure to include many animation techniques such as tweening by position and/or opacity, filters, transformations, and your own manipulated layers.
