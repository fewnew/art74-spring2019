# Project 01: GifcARds
### :one: (.gif + AR)

For this project, you will be creating a printed trigger image and an overlay to convey a larger, interactive, augmented reality experience. Your trigger image and overlay image should be in “conversation” with one another. In other words, the camera image together with the augmented one should create a new reading that emerges when both are seen together.

Your trigger image will be a conceptual digital collage you have made by using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator together to manipulate images. The augmented reality overlay image will be an animated gif you have made in Photomosh. Harness your skills to create a more elaborate animation or a cinematographic style gif. Just use your imagination and create a complicated animation based on a narrative.
