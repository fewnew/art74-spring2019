# Project Description:
   What inspired me to make this picture collage was the concept of giraffes and outer space. I really like how both of these concepts
   complimented each other. When seeing this collage, I can hear the song shooting stars by Bag Raiders playing in my head. The intended 
   context of this collage was a child's imagination of what outer space might look like to them in a cartoon form.
   
   The GIF in this image has a holographic shakiness to it making the image seem like it is really in outer space. I also thought of 
   putting a helmet on him to make it look a little bit realistic.  The mountains behind him give him the ability to touch/become close
   to the moon.
