## Project Description
As a whole, this piece looks and feels girly. It is also youthful and dreamy. I started with three of the same photograph of myself with an anaglyph edit. I worked around this image to put together the rest of the project. I retained the blue and pink motif throughout the whole project. The augmented reality effect gives an edge to the femininity.

I wanted to go for a fantasy, dreamy, surreal aesthetic. I find that I am always in my head daydreaming. I made sure to incorporate my favorite colors (pink and blue) into this piece. In order to create the aesthetic, I used pastel and bright colors. I also added a sky and abstract shapes to add to the surrealism. I was motivated by curiosity and experimentation, which is portrayed in this piece through the text, gradients and shapes.

My intentions for this piece were for it to be purely aesthetic; there is not any deep meaning behind any of the elements besides my personal connections with creating it. The audience is meant to experience it at face value. They can either view the collage as a static piece of art, as a gif, or through augmented reality.

I am influenced by ethereal photography, as it captures a fairytale-like essence. I am also influenced by the way skies appear around dusk and sunset; the colors of the sky constantly paint different colors depending on time of day and the season.
