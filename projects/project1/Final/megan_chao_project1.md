### Description
I utilized the different image textures such as origami clouds behind a vintage flower field with added noise to add a retro technological tone to the image. I felt as if the image was too plain with just the center pieces so I added a different photo from the same photoshoot and cropped just his hands out. The text on his hands translate to “For you, a thousand times over”, a quote from the kite runner. The planets were added because I enjoyed the realistic and high definition photo texture over the less realistic flower background. The planets did, however, feel out of place if they were floating so I added balloon strings to the image and had the hands hold it. In the gif, the planets are swinging. 

Originally, the hands on the right side of the image were supposed to be sprinkling down he water droplets, however, when the water droplets were added I actually liked it on the overall image as a final overlay rather than just under the right hand. 
The original picture had him holding a hose, but I felt that it was not interesting so I added a random texture and included a city landscape inside. I had to flip it upside down to align the lines, but I think it looks better upside down than right side up in the end. 

The picture actually does not have much personal motivation behind it, but more of a conceptual one. My project is a visual representation of a whimsical and dreamlike state in my perspective where the audience is supposed to feel more youthful and happy. My influences for the piece relate back to vintage magazines, but specifically the hand-cut collages people create from the magazines. My influence is also the man in the picture, a Taiwanese singer.
