**Defected Guardian of the Stars**
**Medium**: Print on paper + AR overlay
**Dimensions**: 1800x1054

I used art from a popular PC game, League of Legends. The character Syndra, in my opinion, is motivated by self interest and her top priority is becoming stronger and more powerful. In this cosmetic outfit, she is a 'Star Guardian,' which are much like magical girls and fight alongside each other against great evil. 

However, I don't think the role of Star Guardian suits her because she values strength and power over her allies. It is likely that she would abandon or betray them in her quest for power, which is something her design in this outfit does not convey well.

 Syndra manipulates magic into three spheres that orbit around her. In this attire, these spheres are a bright pink with different personalities conveyed by their faces, in contrast to her default look. I used the sphere from her original splash art because it portrays her more serious nature. To express movement, I added motion blur to each of the orbs. To project her lust for power and control, I added a purple glint to her crown, the root of her power. 

Then I removed the background image because I wanted to add more variation, such as using PNG images of sparkles. I used the 3D line drawing technique because I really liked the gradient and wanted to write out her name.


I explored many different overlays on Photo Mosh, but ultimately I went with a glitch effect instead of something more sinister because she is from a computer game. Like all games, they have bugs, glitches and unexpected errors, and Syndra actually had quite a few weird interactions with other champions and abilities in the game.
