# Description
My collage displayed on this screen is intended to project a very apocalyptic and malevolent beginning. The colors of my collage are somewhat dim, the sun is setting and the stories of monsters you were told of as a child have come true. The reason for the making of this collage is that I've always been interested in the supernatural, even if it isn't real, I've always been interested in shows or movies with a supernatural twist to it.

The scene I've created is based on one of my favorite shows, Supernatural, and it's a reference to two different scenes in the show. The first scene starts with the background and the shooting stars, where the stars are supposedly angels that were dispelled from heaven. In the forefront of the image is an angel that appears to be entering from another dimension, but is actually Lucifer, the fallen angel and the antagonist of the show. The dimension he left is purgatory, which was a temporary imprisonment for him, and the dog besides him is a referrence to the creatures of purgatory that have also escaped into the world.
