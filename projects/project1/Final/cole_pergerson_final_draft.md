# Expand Your Business
---------------------------

My AR project consists of a small trigger image printed on paper and a gif that overlays the trigger. I was inspired by wealth inequality when thinking about what my project but I then I changed my focus to the effects of globalism. Asetheticaly, I was striving for my project to resemble modern business marketing ads. They usually consist of dark cool colors and depict some symbol of prosperity.

This project was intended to look like a business ad targeting other businesses, but the viewer doesn't need to be a business owner. Globalism has brought new products and ideas together from around the world, however, it has amplified an unequal balance in wealth and power. I wanted the viewer to feel the growning frustration of middle and lower class Americans who struggle financially. I was influenced by Scott Galloway who does economical analysis on YouTube. Galloways talks about the winners and losers in the current economy but also goes into the effects they have on people.
