### **Project Description**
***
At the top we see a tongue isolated from the other objects. One might notice the space around and the color of the tongue. It’s normal in color in contrast to its oversaturated and oddly colored counterpart, the sweets. In the GIF the art piece is flashing to be even brighter. The flashing symbolizes alarm to bring more attention to the piece. It’s bright, it’s colorful, it’s overwhelming, it’s a lot to stomach visually. 

Most people don’t realize the amount of sugar that these delightful treats contain. The average person should be consuming around 25 grams of sugar per day, however many people overindulge and surpass this number by an alarming amount on a daily basis. 

This piece is meant to bring awareness, it’s meant to be alarming. It looks fun, it looks bright, but the off-putting colors and overwhelming amount of sweets might tell the viewer otherwise. The audience consumes the art piece with the eyes, just as the stomach consumes food with the digestive system. It’s a lot to take in visually, it’s meant to overindulge the audience’s experience to the point where they no longer want to stare at the bright mess. 

My main inspiration was binging on too many Thin Mints right before the creation of this piece and feeling sick when it was finished. My style and color choice is inspired by Lisa Frank and colorful objects of my childhood, but on steroids. Food is a particularly favorite theme of mine to work with as I’ve related art and design in the past to the topics of food.
