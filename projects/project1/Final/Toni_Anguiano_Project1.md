# Project Description
My digital collage looks like an odd, colorful explosion of geometric shapes meets unamused <b>
classic monsters. Speaking for myself, being the creator of this collage, it feels inviting and <b>
and interesting to stare at. The various bright colors along with the curious shapes hides the <b>
dark undertones of the image containing tortured monsters and a young girl weidling a knife. <b>
Perhaps similar to a venus fly trap; setting off an intriguing allure and not sending out any <b.
indication of something sinister. The personal motivation for this piece was my love for classic <b>
movies and comics in the horror genre. The monsters included in the collage are Frankenstein's <b> 
monster, Count Dracula, the Wolfman, and the Mummy. Underneath them is an intimdating young goth <b>
girl.
The intention for this project was simply to pay homage to classic media, such as film and comics <b>
from the 1930's and on. Often times people forget where today's media was born from and it I wanted <b>
to prove that it has not been forgotten, or pushed aside as though it is no longer of importance <b>
to media today. I would like for my audience to percieve this piece however they like; whether it <b>
be on a computer as a gif jpeg file, as a flat poster on a wall, or as an augmented reality overlay. <b>
I believe the point of the work would get across in any of the above, however they choose to view <b>
the piece. My biggest influences for creating this project are the classic monster I so dearly love <b>
and the music album "*Famous Monsters*" by the Misfits.
