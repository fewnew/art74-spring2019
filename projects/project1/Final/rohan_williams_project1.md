# Description
      For my first digital artwork in Photoshop and Illustrator, I decided to keep things simple and just 
    experiment with the medium rather than try to recreate something that represents my aesthetic wholly. 
    Ordinarily, my art is based on reflections of my fears and anxieties as well as trying to create ties
    with things in the past, especially iconography in art history with my own experiences. I really liked
    the retro feel of the 3-D effect and wanted to make a warped checker pattern which takes me back to 
    video games of my childhood as well as create a contrast with more vintage symbols and imagery. Overall,
    I am happy with my execution of the project, but I would like to make something with more personal symbolism.
    
      The image is of a hand holding a rose surrounded by playing cards in a warped checker-pattern dimension. I enjoy using 
    iconography to contrast complex ideas with very simple symbols. I used playing cards and the vintage hand and dagger to 
    equally create a sense of contrast with the very electric, more modern flare of the 3D and warped background.
