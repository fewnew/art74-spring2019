  The sensations I wanted to make when creating this image is a feeling of something clean cut and simple. The background gradient and the frame are grey and metallic-like, so there is a sense of coldness in the picture. It also allows the other colors in the photo, like the yellow light in the upper left, to stand out.<br><br>
	What I was attempting to do with this graphic is emphasize the distinction between internet art and physical art -- especially something 3d like sculpture. For this I used the Suzie Zamit sculpture over a grayscale gradient. I really love seeing clip art that has a lot of detail and it is clearly evident that whoever made it spent a lot of time on it -- the website Open Clip Art is full of graphics like these that are available for free use.<br><br>
	There aren’t a lot of elements to this collage, it might not even be considered a “collage” at all, but I wanted to keep the picture simple. The gif effect itself is simple, and not completely noticeable until you look closer. Simplicity is something not present in a lot of early internet gifs, like the ones made on Blingee.com, for example -- and I guess I wanted to make an antithesis to that, as much as I love the style of those.<br><br>
