## Description
This video was the first video I decided of doing before I switched up to the other idea of creating a story. Instead, I've been more comfortable with creating pieces of work that makes audiences wonder. I've always been quite peculiar, and I've strategized this within this video. I've found myself always constantly paying attention to music and I've curated music videos in my head. No matter what I'm listening to, I could paint whatever I envision on a piece of paper or even in video production softwares, no matter how unprepared (esp. without an outline) I feel. The song I chose to do this project is by J Dilla, who was a record producer and rapper in the hip-hop scene of Detroit, Michigan. I've grown to like his music within the past few years because his music isn't what was normally found in songs of the early 2000's, where he made his big break before his death in 2006. What I found interesting about this particular sample he used, is the song called "Lightworks", which also complies to the spiritual belief that an individual is a "lightworker", meaning a special person with almost psychic ability to intuit what other people are thinking, feeling, or need in order to heal.<br>
<br> My concept behind this video is basically the evolution of how video fx have drastically changed from manually making overlays to futuristucally-digitally adding overlays using software programs. Conceptually, the girl in the video basically sees what the future has in store for society, as televisions are created, computer editing programs are created, as well as the makeup/beauty revolution. The constant destruction of social media often lead ourselves into the depths of our own darkness, and you feel stuck to the point where you feel panicky, without your devices and/or feel the need to assimilate with new devices and what society expects. Without knowing, J Dilla also added in an adlib from the same artist he used the Lightworks sample that said, "Bendix The Tomorrow People", which actually is from a COMMERCIAL promoting a company that made aircraft and automobile fuel control systems, radios, televisions and computers from 1924â€“1983.<br>
