## Description

It's well known that apps in our phone collect data about us, but do you know how much data is being collected and how often? This was the question that inspired the creation of this video along with [this](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html?module=inline) article. Tech companies are usually very vague when describing how they use your data and I'm not surprised. Take a moment to think about what you do on the internet and try to imagine how companies like Google might use those footprints you leave behind. Sure they record what ads you click on or what you search, but what is stopping them from tracking your patterns and behaviors? What's stopping them from checking your location ten times a minute and then comparing the data you browse on the internet to the places you travel to?

You could turn off your location and internet while traveling, but is that really worth it? The amount of data that is being collected from my phone is probably scary but I don't really care. That is the price I pay for using free services that have helped me get around and discover new people.
