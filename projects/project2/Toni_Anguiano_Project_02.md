## Project Description

     I created this video to create a feeling of uneasiness in my audience. I believe unsettling
     images and videos are more influential than those that are not, therefore I created "Lost Soul".
     The story of the video is a wandering soul trying to find its way out of the fog, looking for
     the end of the mist and the forest. Perhaps it is in purgatory, and does not know how long it has
     been lost for. I wanted this short film to be open-ended and force the viewers to be left haunted. by
     The impression of this film is sadness, emptiness and endlessness. These are the feelings I had
     experienced during the ten years I suffered from deep chronic depression. In which I felt like a lost
     soul and was not sure if I would continue on each day up until about a year and a half ago when I over-
     came it. This small film collage loosely represents how I felt walking through life each day, faking a
     smile and trying to hide what was really going on inside.
