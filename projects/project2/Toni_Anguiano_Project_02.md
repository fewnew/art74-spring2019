## Project Description

     I created this video to create a feeling of uneasiness in my audience. I believe unsettling<b>
     images and videos are more influential than those that are not, therefore I created "Lost Soul".<b>
     The story of the video is a wandering soul trying to find its way out of the fog, looking for<b>
     the end of the mist and the forest. Perhaps it is in purgatory, and does not know how long it has<b>
     been lost for. I wanted this short film to be open-ended and force the viewers to be left haunted. by<b>
     The impression of this film is sadness, emptiness and endlessness. These are the feelings I had<b>
     experienced during the ten years I suffered from deep chronic depression. In which I felt like a lost<b>
     soul and was not sure if I would continue on each day up until about a year and a half ago when I over-<b>
     came it. This small film collage loosely represents how I felt walking through life each day, faking a<b>
     smile and trying to hide what was really going on inside.<b>
