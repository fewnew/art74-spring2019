## Description

"Time to Breathe" is a simple comentary on the differences between my generation and the generations of the past. Without any dialouge, it considers pace, age, and the effects of technology on the calmness and restfullness that we feel. Using three different clips from different sources, the project begins with a young man waking up, already on his phone. As he begins his day, his heart starts to race as he scrolls past texts, news updates, and social media. Just as his heartbeat rises to an uncomfortable speed, the scene changes and an older woman is seen folding clothes. The same heartbeat drums in the background, but at a much slower more comfortable pace. Without the presence of technology stimulating the brain, the heart stays more rested.<br>
