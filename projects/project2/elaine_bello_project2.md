# Description

This video focuses on connection of technology to our surroundings. How in a way, technology acts as a barrier between us and nature. This is because of our fast paced everyday lives and getting caught up in the conveniency of our gadgets. Though, it can act as a barrier, having easy acces to technology and the use of internet also benefits us to be able to connect with what is available around us and to explore possibilities outside of the virtual world. 

Using popular apps such as yelp, waze or google maps as examples, it is free and accessible for anyone to use. As seen in the video, with a quick search on yelp, directions to a regional park along with details and information about the location was shown right away. Without useful apps such as these, it would be a lot harder to locate places. This video is to mostly show that modern life can connect us with what is around us.
