The idea I got for this project was a video that would be presented along with a pitch for advanced A.I that would be able to efficiently run an interconnected city. The video is meant to serve more as background rather than present the final product. Besides the text graphics that were added and the city scenes cut into sequence, the major edits I did to the video pertained to the audio both in adding and creating transitions based upon them. There are multiple times where I try to make a cut to the next scene based off of beats in the music playing. The A.I is formed by voice generators that I had produce the phrases to mimic that of what an A.Iâ€™s duties running a city could be. There are pauses in the video meant to serve as time for a presenter to explain some things or add some insight as this is meant to be paired with a pitch rather than be a stand alone video.
