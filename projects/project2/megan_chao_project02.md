### Description
Influencer is short film based on how society views social media as an outlet for fame and how people are willing to go to extreme measurements to achieve that fame. It also plays on the idea of how viewers enjoy watching the suffering of others for their own entertainment. Influencer also delves deeper into the “behind the scenes” aspect of how popular social media stars are when the audience does not see them just through their posts. 

My project also utilizes how colors play in our minds as even though the video has a darker message, the bright pastel colors give it a more fun and youthful effect.
