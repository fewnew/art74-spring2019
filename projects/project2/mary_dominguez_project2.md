# Description

I often view social media as a stage, where performers display the best of their abilities. Whether its art, beauty, comedy, or anything, you gain attention from those who view them. At times, we find ourselves being addicted to our popularity, forcing ourselves to post more for more views. From this, we gain this false sense of happiness. And other times, we find ourselves the losing performers compared to those with a higher following, leaving us to feel worthless and unimportant. Fake.hapiness is supposed to bring out the negativity of social media. Our character in this video represents our mentality, where we begin to like the “audience” who watch us, forcing ourselves to post more and as we continue this cycle, we slowly lose our minds. 

This video was actually inspired by my friend’s situation, in which she began to feel badly depressed, partly because of the influence of social media. I was able to understand her situation because I often worried about the same things as her. I wanted to bring up facades, insecurity, false happiness, addiction, and even the factor of an invasion of privacy. Maybe not all of these components can be seen, but people can interpret this video however they want.
