# Project 02: cARds
### :two: (vector)

For this project, you will be creating a printed trigger image and an overlay to convey a larger, interactive, augmented reality experience. Your trigger image and overlay image should be in “conversation” with one another. In other words, the camera image together with the augmented one should create a new reading that emerges when both are seen together.
