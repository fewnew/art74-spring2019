I wanted to create something whimsical and playful and at the same time meaningful about how technology has transformed our lives. People  hide under filters and photo editing apps to make themselves feel better about their appearance. In extreme cases, when shared on social media, you can take on a whole new persona.
I think we're becoming more aware of how damaging that is, which is what my character realizes at the end of the video.
