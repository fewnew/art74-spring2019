I wanted to create something whimsical, playful, sort of humorous and at the same time meaningful about how technology has transformed our lives. People  hide under filters and photo editing apps to make themselves feel better about their appearance. In extreme cases, when shared on social media, you can take on a whole new persona.

I also wanted to capture the experience of using our phones and apps by using a snapchat overlay and a vertical phone format. Although this is typically the format video makers avoid when creating a video I believe it adds realism.

I use this character, who's muppet-like, to both create an emotional response and to represent us as a whole. Sure we all experience different degrees of depersonalization when it comes to social media and crafting this identity -- as we all have different expectations of us. However I didn't want to focus on any specific experience to make the message more universal. This character is just blue, it doesn't have a race or gender.

I think we're becoming more aware of how damaging social media can be, which is what my character realizes at the end of the video -- breaking their phone entirely.
