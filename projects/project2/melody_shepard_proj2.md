Description:

I believe most people seem to view technology in a really negative light, but as someone who is really into gaming, technology is pretty much my social life.
I often use Snapchat and Discord to chat and keep in touch with the people I've met through gaming. Without these programs and apps, I wouldn't be able to share passions and interests with people that are similar to me. 
Even though social media is very distracting, especially Instagram, I use it to share videos and pictures with friends instead of posting them myself. 
There is a lot of controversy regarding the public image of people's Instagrams and you could say that people are trying too hard to convince other people that they're happy or it displays unrealistic expectations.

Keeping up appearances seems to be very tedious and draining, especially liking posts of people you aren't even close to. To keep my video in a light mood, I instead used Instagram's explore feature as a way to make my friends laugh and smile at the silly things I send them.
Since I am in a long distance relationship myself, I know how important apps like Instagram, Twitter and Discord are. It gives me and my boyfriend the opportunity to talk to each other daily and to find cute things for us to share with each other.
I had my friend, Chiara play the role of my girlfriend and she is laughing and smiling to herself as I send a video through Instagram. I wanted to capture her expressions and her reaction because it's something the other side can't see.
I wanted to emphasize the visuals of that scene. Another thing, I'm so used to hearing the voices of my online friends that I don't think to imagine their face or how they would react if I were to see them in person.
My intention for the second half of the video was so capture my reaction to a message from her and the stress of communication, particularly telling someone how you feel about them. To some people, expressing that may be very difficult.
I wanted to walk in circles after sending that message, anxious to see how she would respond. And she did, jokingly. I established a sarcastic and playful tone at the start of the video, calling her an "idiot cat lady."
