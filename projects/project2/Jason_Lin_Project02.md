## Description

  The video begins with a serene aerial view of the ocean and a light house. The video proceeds to push forward past the light house, closing onto an island behind it, where there are divers preparing to explore the ocean. The divers jump and slowly descend deeper into the waters until they can no longer handle the cold and proceed to resurface, but as they attempt to resurface, a member of their team begins to lose consciousness and falls to the bottom of the ocean. This member wakes up to the terrors of the deep sea, surrounded by a creature of the abyss.
