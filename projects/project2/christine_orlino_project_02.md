### **Project Description**

We begin with an opening shot of technology. You can see the main character already connected with some sort of electronic device. There’s a brief moment where a friend reaches out to connect. One might think that the main character is finally going to get some social interaction, however the next scene isn’t that different. In fact it’s worse. Now both characters are on their devices and they’re supposedly hanging out and spending quality time together. 

This project was inspired by hangouts and events with my family and peers. We’re supposed to be spending time together, however maybe one person or the whole group is on their phone. It looks awkward to the outsiders and this video is meant to bring attention and awareness to that issue in a sort of comical way. 

The audience will definitely relate to this type of scenario as I’m sure many people of today have experienced or witnessed a similar situation. I want the audience to laugh and possibly feel awkward about this piece because being on one’s phone all day seems to be the norm. Humans are supposed to be social creatures, however technology is driving us to socialize in a way that we haven’t seen before. 

My main influence for my style of editing is YouTubers and my peer from a school club who taught me how to make recap videos of events. A lot of YouTube vloggers that I watch use a lot of transition shots to show movement or time, hence the short clips of different settings or eaten food. My peer who taught me how to use Premiere mainly did recap videos of events. These videos consisted of visuals of an event fitting or setting a mood to music, which can be seen in the second part of the video at the cafe. As I took on his role in the organization editing these recap videos I have found that this method of filming and editing has become my style for making videos.
