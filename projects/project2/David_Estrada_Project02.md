## Description
For this piece, I decided to make something that made us question our technology. Everyday we rely on our devices for many day to day tasks such communicating with our friends and family, using google maps to find a location, taking a picture of yourself, watching videos on YouTube, etc. But do we ever think about where all of this data goes? I created this video to represent someone or something invading our privacy and learning everything about us. Eerything we share and allow our technology and devices to know about us.
