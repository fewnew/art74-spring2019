# Project Description
I wanted to make Pastel Sky a visually cute and multi interactive art ware image that utlizes both mouse functions and key functions. I took inspiration from 8-bit games and played with the aesthetics of pixel art. The process of making software art was entirely new to me, so coding an image and having users play around with my code is very fun and although it is simple, I hope to expand on my knowledge of software art to hopefully create much more complex and diverse synergetic art.
