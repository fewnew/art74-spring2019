For this project I wanted to expand on the smaller assignment that was done in class and add an interactive feature to the small and kind of cartoony city I had made. The first thing I did however was clean up the text from before and remove the border weight so that the letters were not cut into various sections do to being made of multiple shapes. What I decided to do to make it interactive was create a way to draw on the canvas and add a suggested stars feature to make a night sky look. In order to keep the stars from being drawn very quickly I lowered the overall framerate of the canvas. I also added a reset or clear option by simply holding down the mouse button (has to be held due to low frame rate) and just to add a little extra fun element, as well as cleaning the background holding the button will turn off the lights in the city skyscrapers.
