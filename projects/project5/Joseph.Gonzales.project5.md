For this project it was quite interesting for me to make art out of using codes. Normally I am much more of a 2D artist and prefer to be hands on but this turned out to be enjoyable. Once i got the hang of the processing program i was able to figure out the shapes i could make and it gave me complete freedom for my self portrait piece. For this project i did a self portrait of myself and also added and interactive part for the user. The interactive part i left open was for the user to draw with their curser and also to allow the portrait to blink.
