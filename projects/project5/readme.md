# Project 05: ArtWare
### :five: (Software Art)

Students should explore interactive narratives, software art, simulations and emergent behaviors in code-based forms. Techniques and concepts must be presented through the open-source programming environment P5. The functional, interactive forms you present can be an imaginative structure, a self-portrait or any desired imagery.
