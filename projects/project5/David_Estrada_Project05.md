**Title**: Race Car
**Medium**: JavaScript
**Dimensions**: 1520 x 300

  
 **Description** 
  For this project, I decided to create a JavaScript piece of a race car. The vehicle is very basic but it does the job. Once the button on the bottom left is pressed, the race car will accelerate and loop around until the box is pressed again.
