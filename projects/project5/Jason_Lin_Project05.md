# Description

Using the P5.js client, I was able to create this sketch which also includes an interactive feature to it. Without placing your mouse inside the box, it's just a regular panda, but when you move your mouse and click onto the picture it becomes a very psychedelic and mesmerizing interaction. The more you gaze onto it, the more hypnotic it becomes and if you leave your mouse on certain angles of the picture, a hand of a clock appears and that represents the time and endangerment of pandas, in which pandas are sacred to our culture. A panda in our cultures symbolizes peace and friendship and it's also an omen for good luck.
