Description:
Once on the website there is a new button labelled Artware. Once clicked on the button takes you to a page with my artware piece which I named Aries. It is a 400 x 400 sketch using coding. I was inspired by star maps and astrology. Using coding I made two planets one is earth the other is mars. in between is the constellation aries. I choose to create aries because I myself was born under an aries sun.
