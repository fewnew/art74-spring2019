I created this piece using in-line code and by basically playing around with RBG. 
I aspired to make something in relation to the basic RBG, CYMK and black and white in 
relation to the color systems used in web design and so on. I also was experimenting
with the sizing and trying to make each ellipse look as though they are in different 
stages of creation (i.e. beginner, intermediate and advanced). Although this code painting 
is quite simple, it was a long process to get the image to the point that it is at now. 
I plan to keep working onthis piece and adding more to it and play around with the concept 
a bit further. This project has taught me a lot about coding as well as opened a door to a
new way of "painting" and "drawing" that I plan to implement into my process now that I 
understand how basic code works.
