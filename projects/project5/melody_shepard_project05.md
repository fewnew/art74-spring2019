# Description
For my project, I was experimenting with code since I have never done Processing before. I began writing code to draw circles then colored the circles a deep orange color. The interaction is simple, but it's what I was going for. You can move the cursor around that moves the moon so you can cover the sun. I also like how the color palette is very different than what I would normally do, compared to my other works. It's very vibrant and contrasts with the work I did in this class.
