### **Project Description**
***
For this project I actually wanted to build off of an idea of another project I was doing for my senior design class. The project for my senior design class was to create an organization and the branding for it. My team and I decided on being a travel agency called “Preef” that connects people with volunteer opportunities for restoring coral reefs. 

We had this lively, connective, and explosive bubble motif throughout the designs. The dynamic composition of the bubbles represents energy, the dispersion of bubbles represents travel, and the ranging sizes of the bubbles symbolizes growth.

I wanted the animation to represent these ideas. The mouse is free to move anywhere on the canvas, similar to travel, I set a low opacity to symbolize growth as you drag the mouse, and when you left click the mouse it puts a fully opaque circle, representing an energy. When holding the mouse in place one can see the transparent circle slowly grow opaque.

I wanted this piece to embody the values of our nonprofit organization in which we connect explorers to value, discover, and appreciate the wild beauty of the reefs. With their efforts together we can make the coral reefs burst with life.
