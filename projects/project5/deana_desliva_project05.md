# Description

In this final project, I experimented with javascript using the code from p5.js. Learning the code was a bit difficult because it was something i never really learned before. BUt after reading through the reference page, i understood how some of the code worked.

I originally had alot more images added but for some reason the image could not load so I removed that part. In the end, I left it very simple with a nice pastel aesthetics.
