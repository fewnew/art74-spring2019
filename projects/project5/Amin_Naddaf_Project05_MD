For this project, I think It was cool was my profesor taught me, It expaded my knowlegde into coding. 
I had trouble doing it in the begining. By doing the reading I found out how to add a cube with a code, I found out where to 
place objects on the x and y axis. I think that this reading will help me in my future classes as well.
