The interactive beginning so fascinating, as well as the ineractive portions of the video, it definitely caught my attention and pulled me in. Before this class as well as this video I never knew so many things around us revolved around code and that each line of code is basically an instruction or algorithm to tell what the computer to do. 

Knowing that code can contribute to me as an artist really opens up my world of opportunities rather than just relying on photoshop and illustrator, I can concoct a set of code to produce an artwork myself. Ive always had basic knowledge of coding, and i found it very difficult, but this video explains throughly how it works. For example something like color, I always assumed you plugged in the word of the color and it worked, but never new it was based on number values too.
