I found the Interactive tutorial very interesting and informative on creating and designing using javascript. It was cool having a video teach me how to code and how things function accordingly all the while having an interactive exercise to practice with. I learned the basics of coding using javascript and while it's going to take a while getting use to, compared to using html and css, I think I'll enjoy it just as much.

I also found it very interesting how processing is practically used in many ways and in many things related to art and design. Fashion, 3D printing, and even in architecture is processing used. Another part of the tutorial I found interesting and fun was how you're able to create a trail of shapes and any other objects or images in javascript. I know I'm definitely going to be using this for one of my future projects.
