Before watching the video with David Shiffman, when I would hear the term "proccesing" I used to freak out a bit because I thought it would be very difficult to understand it. But it took me while to undestand that it is very common with p5 and I felt a lot more confident with the coding.

For some reason, understanding the shapes, colors and how to interract with proccesing was very easy and so entertaining. I love playing with codes. On top of that getting lectured in class and with David was a plus!! this is probably what I love doing the most.
