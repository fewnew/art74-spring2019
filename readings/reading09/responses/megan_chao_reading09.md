I really enjoyed the video and how interactive it was. It kept me entertained and interested throughout the whole process. It was very fun to also be able to recreate the exercises that he was teaching as it made the learning experience easier and better. I had no previous knowledge of Processing code before so to be able to learn a new medium like this and fully interact with the code in a very easy way is helpful. 
I always wanted to get more into coding as well as I believe that it is the future of art and tech design and it is a very useful skill to learn so I am happy we are learning different coding languages and utlizing free tools to further our knowledge. I am glad we started to code as well because it gave a break in "traditional" art to learn something that would benefit us all such as creating websites.
