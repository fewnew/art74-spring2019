I enjoyed watching the video tutorials. I feel as though I have a greater understanding of coding, and the ways I can be creative through coding, after watching it and interacting with the tutorials.

I liked seeing the art pieces that involved coding during the introduction of the tutorial. Though this tutorial is a basic explanation of how to code and are limited in this way the examples make me more motivated to learn this further.
