The interactive exercises for Hello Processing! Was very fun and informative on the code that is processing. It definitely helped ease into the code that may seem overwhelming to some people and broke it down into its fundamental parts. It was a nice introduction and gave me a few ideas for the upcoming project and how I would want to approach it.

The fact that it gave a video tutorial was also very helpful as I was able to pause and play at the pace I wanted to take a little more time with. The beginning was also a very informative section that talked about how code is used in more contemporary art settings and the types of works that people are currently exploring through the use of code. It definitely makes you wonder how much the art scene is going to change in the future as more and more technologies are discovered and become available to the masses.
