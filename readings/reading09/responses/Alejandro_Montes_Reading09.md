The interactive tutorial on *HelloProcessing!* was a pretty interesting way to teach programming for beginners, it made it less intimidating and made it seem quite easy. I myself, knowing nothing about programming, had always thought about it as a complicated thing to do. However, the way this tutorial was set up, just teaching the basics was helpful. Not only did he go step by step on what you should do and what you should put first, but there was a space and time for you to actually try it out yourself. This tutorial helped me understand function, the coordinate system, and a block.

The part that interested me the most was the first example he showed as an example of how programming has been used in the visual arts. *Strata #3* by Quayola was visually pleasing to me and would be amazing if I could create something like that. As to the tutorial, the part I found most interesting was the "Interact" section, finding out how to animate the functions and drawings is something I look forward to experimenting with.
