     I enjoyed the speaker on the tutorials of Hello Processing. His energy and passion about the
     process of writing lines of code made me feel like this is a really exciting topic and intrigued
     me. Watching these tutorials helped me to better understand the structure of writing a line
     of code, or basically understanding what the structure was and how the function works. I had an 
     idea before but while creating my project 04 website, I have basically just been experimenting 
     to see what works and what does not. The explanations on the tutorials made sense and was easy to 
     follow along with and I like the idea of having the audience interact with the tutorial because it 
     helped me retain what I was learning.
     
     My favorite portion of the tutorials was the video about how add in color mainly because that was
     was something I found myself struggling with while making my website. Not so much adding in color
     as trying to figure out how the function worked. I would shoot in the dark and hope for the best.
     I did not really consider that there had to be an order of operation to the process. So when the
     teacher brought t up, it was like a lightbulb went off in my head. The tutorials were easy to follow
     along with and made coding a bit easier to understand on a beginner level.
