When I first started processing, I found it very different than coding in HTML and CSS. I think videos really help when starting out and some things can be more understandable in audio with visuals rather than text and reference images. This instructor teaches everything in a really digestable way. I think it's really fun to experiment with shapes and design because great compositions form from simple shapes.

I also found color to be kind of challenging because I used a line of code that turned the entire shape into one color when I meant to only have one color per shape. It was also really nice to know that I could change the outline(stroke) of a shape for a more 3 dimensonal effect. I found these tutorials incredibly helpful because I had little experience in Processing. I was able to draw shapes and position them in a way that I liked, but I always struggled with the animation part. I struggled with having interacivity, but these lessons helped me understand Processing as a whole, much better.
