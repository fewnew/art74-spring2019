I'm so glad I was introduced to Hello Processing! After project 4, I felt somewhat content on how I've been using code. In the future, I hope to be able to do it with easy, as I know it will come with much practice. Seeing someone so fond with teaching makes learning code bearable, as well as more comfortable knowing that you too could possibly be like this person. I really enjoyed the interactive portion especially as it provides great practice that I could refer to in the near future when I really start getting a handle of coding and producing websites.

Seeing the types of new media that have been created due to learning code, really inspires me to go out and beyond in my near future when I have an idea to settle. For a long time I've been on artist's block, and especially since I've been more familiar with graphic design and illustration, using these tools could furthermore help me create new ideas as well as introduce a new medium for my audience/supporters.
