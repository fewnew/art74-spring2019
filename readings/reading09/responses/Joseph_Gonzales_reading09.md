After watching the video about processing i felt very confident and inspired about trying out the program. It was a lot different than when i first experience atom because i feel like the knowledge that i took from atom definitely helped with processing and made it more understanding. Before the video i never knew what processing was or even about its existence. The whole concept behind processing seems very fun to use and not as intimidating as other coding programs. 

The ability to make and create shapes through the “x,y” coordinates of measurements made the processing easy and make more sense as a math calculation.  With making an interactive project the functions that were needed were able to color and fill in shapes or transform shapes to make whichever object we needed. The processing program made way for more creativity for the user and much more enjoyable.
