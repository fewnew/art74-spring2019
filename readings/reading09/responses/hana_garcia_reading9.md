Watching the videos helped me to understand the process of coding a lot better. The interactive features of the coding helps to give the person who is running the software a better understanding of how changing the coding can effect the end result. I felt like explaining what the sequences of the numbers of the coding stood for helped me to understand it so much better. The explanation of using the fill and stroke and how the number for the RBG color selector change the overall color of the shape. Adding the unstatic parts to the coding was also really cool because it made the end result more interactive. 

It was really interesting to learn that the different ways in which the coding can create art. From the fashion designs using it to help them create 3D shapes to make a piece of clothing. Seeing how adding dimension in a garment changes things. Also seeing how the artists create architecture and interactive exhibits is interesting.
