What I found really interesting about this video is all the kinds of art artist have done by using coding in the
beginning of the video. I also really like how interactive this video was by doing the excersises it provides. 

My Favorite part of these videos is being able to do tutorials and taking your time with each design you are 
trying to make.This video really helped me understand what coding really is and helped me see it in a esaier way.
