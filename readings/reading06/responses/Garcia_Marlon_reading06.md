While reading the 3D Additivist Cookbook, I found it to be a bit difficult what the real message it was trying to provide other than showing us different techniques that have been around. 

Some things that really caught my eye where points that were made off in the first reading like #9 Hacks/cracks/viruses for 3D printing software, every since I started dedicating myself to coding I tend to get very triggered to learn more things about it. I would like to learn how to prevent those things from happening. But going back to some of the things I found while reading the book was the evolution of the spermalege, when I look at the projects it made total sense, Much of Joey Holder’s work references a very weird nature and features an array of creatures that don’t seem to blend within the fabric of our 
usual day-to-day existence.
