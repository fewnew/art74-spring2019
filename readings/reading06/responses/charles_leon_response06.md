The reading mainly focuses on how the advent of 3d printing and printmaking is an avenue to really change society and how people live and work. It takes a revolutionary approach almost, in that there is a lot of call to either act on or recognize the aspects that change dramatically with the 3d printer.

Personally it was a little difficult to understand fully what the purpose of the 3D Additivist Manifesto. There are some parts that I can understand by drawing back to when we viewed that hyperlink narrative about glitch art and the practice of it. However there are other times where it seems this short read tries too hard, or intentionally is intense to the point of sounding cult like especially in lines like “Additivism can emancipate us. Additivism will eradicate us.” and it is hard to see if this is taken in a serious tone or is meant to be satirical in form.
