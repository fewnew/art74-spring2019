What I found interesting about the reading is that these artists uses 3d printingg, something of modern technology, to describe the recreation of materials that once come from the earth. I at first did not expect to read about the deeper meaning behind these scultpures and the revolution of 3d printing. I find that their own defintion of 3d printing is revolutionary and could understand the reason behind the title of the book.

I found the religious aspects that go into 3d printing really interesting and was wondering what this had to do with their logic. As I read more, I begin to understand that these aspects encorporates the idea of Creation. One of the artworks in this section that i found interesting was the "Private parts of Gods and Saints." I am curious as to what these sculptures look like or what is the meaning behind it.
