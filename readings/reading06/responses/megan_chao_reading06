I decided to research the topic of 3D printing biointelligent membranes. I think the topic is very interesting as it could be a potential solution to the future of the world in regards to climate change. The thought of creating genetically modified organisms that can adapt to the deteriorated environment is a very real situation that can occur even within the next 50 years. The concept is that the organisms would produce isolating fibers that would protect whoever would wear them in the situation of an Ice-Age if the polar ice caps continue to melt and flood at the rate in which they currently are. The fibers are meant to prevent water from penetrating the skin for the time being until the Earth eventually restores itself. 

I think it is really important to start developing and creating resolutions to potential world issues. Because climate change is more prominent than ever and the rate of our carbon footprint is increasing due to the higher demand of production, we need better solutions now more than ever to protect our Earth.
