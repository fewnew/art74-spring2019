In the reading for this assignment it was on the “ 3D Addivist”. It talked about how 3D printing is this whole new boom that will help change society and how people work, react and live. The reading talks about how 3D printing can help with the revolutionary development of the human. Helping out in society by creating things with the plastic that isn't able to be created any other way.  The 3D printer gives endless opportunities for its system, being able to create and fix anything possible. 

What i thought was interesting was how  the author would talk about the 3d printer as if it would take over our life to where it would be something we could rely on. The 3d printer would then take place for many areas being able to create new things with its plastics that we haven't been able to before. I don't really think i would totally agree with relying on something like a printer for something like replacing a body part or any type of intake. The 3d printer can be both good and bad but i think it will interesting where it can go in the future.
