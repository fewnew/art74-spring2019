After reading part of The 3D Additivist Cookbook and looking through some of the projects mentioned, one of them caught my attention and appeared to be interesting. The project is called “URME Recipes: Cooking with Privilege,” by Leo Selvaggio. This project is what you’d see in a cookbook, it gives you 4 different “recipes,” recipes in which you can use the face of the author/artist as the ingredient, the main and only ingredient. An ingredient that can be downloaded and printed out, a photorealistic 3D printed prosthetic, or a 3D digital model, all are a masks of the author/artist. 

I found it interesting how the artist uses his face as a multiple piece that can be bought, downloaded and customized. He takes his white privilege and uses it to create a way so that minorities could either receive or create protection for themselves by wearing a mask of a white male. Knowing the struggles minorities face, he literally creates a face and allows others to use it for protection and safety. It’s just pretty cool how you can create something so helpful by making projects through 3D models and prints.
