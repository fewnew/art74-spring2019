I have always loved looking at infographics, it is such a wierd thing to say. 
I think they are very attracting to the eye, it draws the audience in and gives the designers opportunity to play around with the different data they have been given.
Infographics are used a lot to show visuals on articles and magazines. As a visual learner it helps alot to have a graphic of some sort to help understand all the text is thrown at me in an article.
I'm so used to seeing stuff that get put onto pinterest (like for example, 5 tips to keep your chin up) I forget that originally it was meant for quick and to the point information.

One thing the article never talked about was the information. Designers are given the information and they have to pry out the key information and not to mention, making it aesthetically pleasing for their audience.
Many people see them on social media but they probably dont exactly know what infographics.
it is interesting to see the business and marketing side of this type of work.
