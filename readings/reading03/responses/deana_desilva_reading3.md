i know that inforgraphics have an importance in advertising data and information. i don't feel any lure to infographics myself, although i know that there are people who find them aesthetically pleasing due to their simplistic ways of presenting data. I myself am a visual learner however most infographics i see like for example out on campus aren't very intriguing to me. Maybe it's just because of the data that's being presented, or maybe it's just way too simplistic that i can't find any interest in them. 

i know that infographics are highly used for business, marketing and etc, as it is enforced in the article that i read. i know the youtube channel Crash Course heavily uses what seems to be infographics in their educational videos. Correct me if i'm wrong but i find those very appealing when used in media such as that. I feel like since i'm so lazy to be doing the reading myself i get lost and disinterested in the infographic. But because they do voice overs and animations on their infographics it becomes much more alluring and appealing to me and makes me want to give notice to these works of media.
