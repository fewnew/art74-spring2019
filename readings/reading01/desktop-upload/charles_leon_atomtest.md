The Article for the most part served as a refresher for me, having previous experience with the physics of lights. Reflection, refraction, and color diffusion are not new concepts to me personally (Not to say that they are not interesting) as I spent a good month or so in the past learning about and how to use equations to measure light such as the explained snellâ€™s law. Color, at least what we perceive as color, is the reflection of certain wavelengths by various objects that our eyes are able to detect. Objects have color based off of what wavelengths they absorb and reflect, at least within the visible spectrum.

What was more interesting to me however was when the reading began to talk about color attributes. These were concepts I was introduced to on a surface level in previous art classes and never really looked into in depth.  That being said what piqued my interest the most were the color mixing types, additive and subtractive. Additive color mixing I recognized from past experience coming from studio work, but never really looked into besides simply knowing what colors are produced when multiple are shown in a studio. Subtractive color mixing was really new to me and as I read along it started to make more sense with its use, beging with white light and creating the desired color from filtering out other colors.
