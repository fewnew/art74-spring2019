After reading Understanding the Light, my knowledge of color theory and light has not only been refreshed, but I also learned more in depth about these topics. I have previously known about a few aspects of color theory: the subtractive and additive color models, and RGB and CMYK color mixing, but I was able to gain a deeper understanding. Color theory was discussed in this article in relation to light which helped me to understand how they work together. This reading began with the exploration of light and then moved into the different temperatures of light, their colors, and a deeper discussion about color theory. I learned about light in more of an artistic sense in this article, unlike other cases where I learned about light in science classes.

Viewing light in this context will help me improve in my artistic endeavours, such as how to use light and color in various situations like photography and realistic drawings. I learned about the attributes to light that I was never introduced to before. For example, since the intensity of light is relative, the brightness of an object depends on the contrast lighting conditions. As an artist, being taught the foundations of art and design is incredibly important.
