Understanding the Light was an interesting webpage. Many people already have a small backgroung of what light is, electromagnetic waves, but this article more in depth on how it work and what light does in different situations. It was hard to read the whole webpage, there was so much information being thrown out at you. I wasn't able to read the whole article, I needed to take a break from it. My favorite part of Understanding the light was the videos, they brought in more information about the little sections they were talking about. I knew quite a bit of this from taking color theory and also different science classes, the information wasn't new it just went more in depth on what light does under different situations.
