The documentation about light provided several scientific explanations of the way light is manipulated and shown within our daily lives. It is interesting to read about how different variables play into the way light is presented such as reflection on different surface textures to the different temperatures white light can omit and the way the color rendering index is affected in contrast with different light sources. I also enjoyed reading about the different attributes of light. In the age of social media and how accessible it is to edit pictures through a phone or laptop, I think many people in my generation already understand how hue, saturation, brightness, and tones can all alter light we see in pictures. I particularly found the Vsauce video explaining mirrors and how they contribute to the way we see light interesting as it is a concept I never thought about before. 
The entire article, <i> Understanding the Light <i>, is very relevant to how we, as artists, create our pieces. For example, if one tends to work with shadows a lot, the placement of the light and highlights is important to the realism of the piece. Colors also play into the effect of how they reflect off of surfaces and how each color mixes with one another. Understanding the basis of what creates the images that we see can only help develop our pieces.
