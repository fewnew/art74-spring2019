I found this reading very interesting since I work with lighting and materials in Unity3d. I was familiar with some of the lighting terms but I never knew what they actually meant. I figured out that specular lighting reflects all light rays in the same direction while diffuse scatters the rays in different directions. This is very important in determining how an object will reflect light and what kind of surface it has. The section about color temperature was pretty interesting to me since that can be important for changing the mood of an environment. Defining what kind of color temperature you want for a color palette is critical to how your art piece looks because you can't mix different color temperatures together. I was very familiar with the attributes of colors since I have tried to make some of my own color palettes before.

My geeky math side enjoyed reading all the parts that talked about the physics of light. I never knew how complex light can be and I could imagine it being tricky to recreate in a 3D engine. I thought it was so cool that you could split white light into different colors and then recombine them to create white light. Any light that doesn't reflect off an object gets absorbed and turn into heat. I always figured black was absorbing light like a black hole but instead it was absorbing color. How light can affect the color of an object is fascinating. The reading gave examples of the same photo with different colors shining on the objects. In a way it was altering the reality of what you actually see.
