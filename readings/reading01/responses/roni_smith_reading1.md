Before reading the article I had a vague understanding of light and color theory. I knew that colors exist in wavelengths, traveling at the speed of light. They are a product of the eye interacting with light and the light interacting with objects in the environment. 
Iâ€™ve learned that we process colors through their refractions on objects -- and are either reflected or absorbed. Objects reflect their own color and absorb all other wavelengths, except white and black which reflect and absorb all colors, respectively. Color mixing, like through stage lighting, is all about how lights change through the absorption / reflection of other lights. This is all determined by what colors are already present within the light.
