  The article I read, I learned that Newton demonstrated his experiment that white light can be dispersed to different colors 
and then composed back to white again. This article got me a deep understanding of light and color, I totally understand that 
white light is a mixture of all colors of the rainbow which can be broken up into a prism which is called full spectrum. 
I fully understand what is color temperature and color rendering. I learned that color temperature is a light source of a 
radiator that radiates light of a comparable hue of the light source and color rendering is an effect of objects by conscious 
or subconscious comparison with the color appearance, but most importantly I learned that colored light have specific 
wavelengths which some transparent objects allow wavelengths of light to penetrate.

  One thing I found really interesting in the Bill Nye video was when mixing all colors of the rainbow you get white light, 
although if you mix it all with paint it doesnâ€™t work that way because it is absorbing light which makes all of it turn into a 
dirty color of brown. Another thing I found interesting was colors like white, gray and black, are called achromatic colors, 
other colors like red, blue, green are called chromatic colors. This article helped me alot to understand  about the light and 
colors which this is really going to help me for this class and I hope there will be future assignments 
like these to learn.
