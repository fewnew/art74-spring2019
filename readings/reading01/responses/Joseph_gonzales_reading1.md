In this first reading it covered where light comes from and ways that light can be used. The reading went over the basics of light, like how light comes in wave lengths and how we are able to see the colors that appear in our everyday life. It went over how light makes up different colors and what happens to these colors when they appear next to each other and make up a totally new color. The reading helped give an explanation on why we use light the way we do on how we reflect light or even use filters with lighting.  One of the interesting things that i read about was on how the colors of the sky have to do with the speed of the wavelengths of light. For instance violet and blue light are slower than orange and red light. 

I felt that i can relate to this reading because i am a illustrator and a painter as well. The section of the reading where it went over a bit of color theory is something i can relate to because of the selection of colors and mixing of colors is put to use almost everyday when i am painting. This reading was also helpful with the use of stage lighting and also on how to set up the lighting so it reads best to an audience. I learned about how to angle the light fixture so it doesn't bind an audience and also learned on which filters help appeal to the eye best.
