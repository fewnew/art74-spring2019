Throughout this article i didnt really pay attention to any of the words said. I didn't even bother to read it. I mostly just watched  the videos that were provided. Most of these videos had a common concept. This being that white light is a mixture of all the colors in the rainbow. As well as the reason for us seeing color, is because that object, ie. an orange, is absoribing every other color, except for orange and deflecting that to our eyes. 

Although i learned most of these concept in my physics honors class in high school, it's cool to see how much lights affects our art, be it just the colors or the perception of colors. It was good to know i didn't forget things like electormagnetic waves interacting with their molcules create the colors we see and that everything around us reflects and emitts electromagnetic waves. Light frequency is equivalent to color, the lowest being red while the highest frequency is purple. Black things like shirt absorb all frequencies of light, which is why wearing one in the summer can make you feel hot and sweaty.
