          I found Understanding the Light as a very informative read with in depth details about the different components that go
     into color and light theory. As an art major I have used similar information and theory such as in this article in my own artwork.
     The normal painter things like mixing my own black paint using complementary colors and creating tint and shade variations by
     mixing primary/secondary colors with white and black. One of my art professors in the past used the transparent prism demo to
     show us how white light can enter one side and exit the opposite side as a rainbow. Physically I have learned how colors interact
     among each other and studied how the human eye reacts to them. However, the reiteration and being reintroduced to the concepts
     are a nice refresher because I had not realized how much of the information I forgot. I enjoyed the videos about the color spectrum
     and the different types of wavelengths and what their purposes are. 
          I did feel though that viewing the videos and looking at the photos of how light and color is absorbed or reflected helped to better
     my understanding of what the article was trying to adamantly explain. I also enjoyed the in depth detail about the different functions
     of light and attributes of color, such as luminous flux, intensity, illuminance, saturation, hue and so on. The author made strong
     points and I believe he did quite an effective job because usually I have a rough time reading these kinds of articles. Normally I
     have to read them more than once to understand what is trying to be said, but the concepts included were easy to follow along with
     when examples were included. There was a lot of information implemented in this writing. It was an easy and clear read. After reading
     this article, I cannot wait to implement some of these theories into my digital work and I would like to learn more about color
     rendering as well as manipulating light with additive colors, if that makes sense.
