  Since I've hardly ever taken an art class before, some of this information was very new to me. I found this article very
interesting, especially in the Bill Nye video where he explains that when the white light is hitting the prism of science,
it breaks up into different colors that is seen on a rainbow, this is also called a full spectrum. And when you reflect it 
onto another prism, the colors aren't able to break up into another color because its already a pure color. I also learned 
that if a light is hitting an uneven surface a certain angle, this would cause the light to bounce in many directions.

    When skimming through the article, I saw a paragraph talking about hue, saturation, and brightness and it really helps 
  me understand what each of them meant. It also helps me on what I should do when I'm adding paint onto another and what
  to expect.
