Being a traditional artist, I find learning about light
in a new way very intriguing. Paul Klee is one of my favorite artists
and love playing with color in traditional art, so I am very happy to see
 him quoted here. It also relaxes me to learning a new medium because it
  shows me that light and color are important in a digital format as well
  as in traditional mediums. The pictures and diagrams are eye-catching and
  informative. I especially love the examples of the contrast between cool
   and warm light. They really emanate the feeling, the chill, and warmth
    of the colors of the light. It is interesting how different the depiction
     and creation of light was compared to the how it actually interacts in
      reality. It makes me want to be more aware to what color of light I am
       using and how it affects the color of my subject. Also, light has
        a lot of cool vocabulary words: flux, illuminance,
        monochromatic radiance-- they all sound really cool.
