When reading “understanding the light’ the beginning introduction test reminded me of an astronomy project I had back in high school when we used the see the brightness of the stars, and it would ask those type of questions about brightness and hues. Watching the very first video of electromagnetic spectrum made me realize that not only stars have electromagnetic waves but microwaves, tv's, modem routers, phones, etc. Another thing that I never really notice was that we can’t really see light itself, but its reflection and its very interesting.

white light is a mixture of all the colors of the rainbow. I was amuse to find out that just like a red apple, the apple is absorbing all of the colors of the rainbow except red and it reflects the color red, or like an orange is the same way, it absorbs all the colors except orange and reflects orange. Another thing that really caught my attention was the fact that me personally I didn’t know what color a mirror was, because a perfect mirror would reflect all colors of light in my perspective. but not all mirrors can do that according to the video and kind of reflect a greenish color.
