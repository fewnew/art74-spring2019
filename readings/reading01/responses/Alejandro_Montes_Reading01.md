After reading the “Understanding The Light” lecture, it really reminded me of several courses I have taken before. Painting being one of them, in which we learned about color and how additive color was used when we were mixing colors. Color class being another one, and in this one we discussed most of the key terms in the lecture. Tints and shades, hue, value, intensity and we even talked about color schemes, which include complementary colors, split compliments, triad, tetrad, analogous and monochromatic color schemes. We learned about their relationship with each other and how they work together creating something eye catching and harmonious.We were also able to make two different colors look like one by playing around with the intensity of certain colors for example. 

Some interesting things I learned from the lecture were things as simple as us not being able to see light as it travels, we really see light when it reflects on something. Also knowing that white is not the absence of color but that it’s the opposite, that white light actually contains a mixture of all colored lights. Another thing I found interesting about the lecture was color temperature, how candlelight is around 1850K and Dusk light could be 8000K. It’s just amazing to know how our eyes and light work with each other.
