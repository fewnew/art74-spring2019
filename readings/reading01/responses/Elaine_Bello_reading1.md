  The article, Understanding The Light breaks down not only the characterizations of light, but also how we have evolved with our knowledge on manipulation and the different uses of light. Light is categorized through its wavelength, the distance between two waves. The other characterization is through frequency,the speed of the wave motion measured in hertz (amount of waves per sec). The article also talked Newton's Prism experiment in which white light has the ability to be broken up to different colors by the use of a prism, which reveals full spectrum of colors of the rainbow.
  
  As someone who works with all types of medium of paint, it is interesting to learn about the reasoning why the colors that I mix together are the way that they are. As well as learning about additive and subtractive in color lighting and how for example adding colors with lighting such as red and green creates an amber color, as to for example, oil paint would mix as maybe a deeper brown. I also really enjoyed reading through the case studies and watching the performance art of Found and Lost by Charlotte Öfverholm and lighting design by Pavel Kotlík. I am fascinated by performance art and to read and really analyze what was the intention behind the color use for the performance allowed me to have great appreciation for the artist to know the science behind lighting and how to manipulate that into another work of an artist harmoniously.
