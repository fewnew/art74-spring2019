Understanding the Light focuses on the different aspects of lighting, how it can be used in lighting scenes as well as be photographed, and be used in theater lighting. There are reading starts by just explaining how light works with our eyes to see objects and what is reflected off of objects.

The reading covered the qualities of light such as reflection, refraction, and scattering and how depending on the environment light is passed through reflected or absorbed. White light is another topic that is looked at explain that white light is light with no color but depending on the temperature of the light source the light appears cooler or warmer. It later goes on in color rendering index to explain the attributes of colors and how light can affect hue, saturation, and brightness.
