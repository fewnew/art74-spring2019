After reading Greene Rachel's work "Web Work, A history of Internet Art" I finally understand where the term Net.art comes from, It is very interesting how a simple mistake can make something so big and make it a trend, 

I came to the same conclusion as Glitch Art, I find it very difficult to treat is as Art, maybe its because I am very picky when it comes to identifying what art really is. I might be wrong but it just doesn't feel like art to me specially when it comes from a mistake, but my opinion does not chance the fact that its considered art and I can understand why many artist are very passionate about it!
