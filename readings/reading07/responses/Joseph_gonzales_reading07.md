For reading 07 it was on a article called “Web Work, A History of Internet” by Rachel Greene. I was able to learn what net.art was exactly. I have never heard about net.art before hand and found it quite interesting on how it was discovered. Net.art was discovered by accident , it accidentally happened by a software glitch when Vuk Cosic, a Slovenian artist opened up and anonymous email. This anonymous email created a space for artist to have unlimited control of their artwork. 

The movement seems to hold  great advantages for artist and have a space where they are able to work without any constraints. The platform that Net.art made gave artist the ability to present their art to a bigger audience to show the world what they are doing . The great thing about Net.art was that these artist were not just doing art for a political background but just for the sake of art.
