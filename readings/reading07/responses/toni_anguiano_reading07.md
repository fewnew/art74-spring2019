I found reading 7, "Web Work" by Rachel Green, very interesting due to the fact that<b>
the discovery of net.art was basically a complete accident made by Vuk Cosic. Rachel<b>
Green goes into greatdetail about how artists reacted to this new odd web art concept<b> 
and how many of them implemented the internet into their work. Though this was all going<b>
on in the mid to late 90s, I remember certain sites created by the artists in this article,<b>
such as Nettime and The Well. A past teacher also had us explore Jodi.org and I am surprised<b>
to find that this collab web art was created after a visit from San jose. Nice to know we<b>
inspired someone.<b>
Another part of the article I enjoyed is the light-heartedness of the artists, such as<b>
Nettime or the artist that named their site "7-11", though the article was not entirely<b>
clear on that. I like that many artists wanted to create art on the net as a means of<b>
lightening the mood or just to make jokes, sending mass emails to people and confusing<b>
them on whose pitching what and why. I love art that has a meaning behind it, but I also<b>
feel like art does not necessarily need to have a meaning to be enjoyable, and that is<b>
what I am taking away from the 90s net artists featured in this article.<b>
