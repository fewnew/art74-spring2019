I found reading 7, "Web Work" by Rachel Green, very interesting due to the fact that
the discovery of net.art was basically a complete accident made by Vuk Cosic. Rachel
Green goes into greatdetail about how artists reacted to this new odd web art concept 
and how many of them implemented the internet into their work. Though this was all going
on in the mid to late 90s, I remember certain sites created by the artists in this article,
such as Nettime and The Well. A past teacher also had us explore Jodi.org and I am surprised
to find that this collab web art was created after a visit from San jose. Nice to know we
inspired someone.

Another part of the article I enjoyed is the light-heartedness of the artists, such as
Nettime or the artist that named their site "7-11", though the article was not entirely
clear on that. I like that many artists wanted to create art on the net as a means of
lightening the mood or just to make jokes, sending mass emails to people and confusing
them on whose pitching what and why. I love art that has a meaning behind it, but I also
feel like art does not necessarily need to have a meaning to be enjoyable, and that is
what I am taking away from the 90s net artists featured in this article.
