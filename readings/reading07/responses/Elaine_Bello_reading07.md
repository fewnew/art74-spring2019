Before this reading, I've heard of the term "Net.Art" but never really knew the definition behind it or its origin. I find it interesting that this found art wasn't really found, but merely a mishap from a software glitch. After reading through this reading, I also find that this "new" form of art is pretty open to different types of people. Since the internet is such an easy way of communication, it's not surprising that not only artists have shown interest in this ongoing dialogue.

The part where the reading talked about cyberfeminism caught my attention the most. Anne de Haan's manifesto on "The Vagina is the Boss on the Internet" posted on Nettime in 1996, it caused to be an issue of interest. List moderators told them then to take the conversation "somewhere else" to a women's platform as if they were entitled to the female's decisions. Despite this, one "femail" net.artist Olia Lialina further published highly elegant projects and out-programming her male peers.
