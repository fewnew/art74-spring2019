I really enjoyed reading this reading because it gave me some nostalgia of growing up in the early ages of the internet. I often see the rough aesthetic that many artists use nowadays to represent late 90's to early 2000's in their pieces of art, and I often find myself wanting to do the same. 
Growing up with having computer-engineer and engineer relatives who worked with computers all day using code, really brought me back as, during that time it was used for work but now everything is automatic by touching one button rather than manually entering something. In a way, I do kinda wish that most of us could regain a little bit from the past and give us an option to make our computers look "retro".

Aside from this, a lot of these net.artists are really taking initiative of their craft, as well as giving a deeper meaning. I find it amazing beccause I wouldn't know if I could be able to pull off these projects.
