In Rachel Greene's "Web Work, A History of Internet Art," I found it pretty fascinating how the term, "net.art," was coined because of its similarity to the origin of glitch art. Vuk Cosic opened an email, but only to find that it had glitched out and was only left with one legible term, "net.art."  If I were to assume, I would say that glitch art became a trend following the rise of net.art.

Even in the late 1990s, people could be concerned about their personal data on the internet or on their computer. An example of this is Jodi.org, which would post your IP address and it could be collecting data about your computer's hardware and possibly other personal data. Especially in this present day, we need to be careful who we interact with and what type of information we are letting social media or apps access. In a chatroom in the 1990s, there was a man who pretended to be a woman; there are no shortages of examples in the modern age due to how easy it is to access information online and use someone else's pictures and personal history as your own persona.
