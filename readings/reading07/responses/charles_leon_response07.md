The reading focuses a lot on what it terms as “net.art” which is  something similar to what we have already look at as glitch art. Hearing about artist use of the internet and how it was implementing into their work was very interesting and made me think about how we as humans have really challenged art and made it with and out of anything. It was also very interesting to see how creative they got very early on with projects such as the link/window narratives where clicking would bring up a new part of an on going story.

There was one example used where the code was used as the primary content in the work rather than what it may have made or rendered. I found this varying interesting especially because I have heard of a museum in germany that is based around code for video games. The code is the major work they are looking to preserve rather than the content that the game has or the visuals it produces. It makes me wonder on the future of art preservation and how we will be viewing art from today in a much different way sooner or later.
