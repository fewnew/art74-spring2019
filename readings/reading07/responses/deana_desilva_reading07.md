this article was somewhat interesting although it didnt keep my attention for very long. skimming through the pictures and examples were really interesting as well. one part of the article that caught my attention was about the basis of net art and how it was discovered. i very much agree that you can turn almost anything into a piece of art work, even if it was originally a mistake/accident.

the only experiences ive had with net art would be platforms like tumblr which, im sure many of my classmates can relate to, were really big during our middle and high school phases. as one with multiple tumblr pages or blogs i should say, im very comfortable with the types of code tumblr themes used in order to customize your blog to you liking. although tumblr themes were fairly easy to use in comparison to some other programs. to this day i still use my main tumblr account and changing the layout and theme of it is still always a pleasure.
