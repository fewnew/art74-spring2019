After reading the article "Web Work, A History of Internet" by Rachel Greene, I was able to learn a few things. I was mostly interested in finding out about net.art, I had actually never heard of such term or what it referred to. I found it interesting how the term was created by accident, it was the result of a software glitch when Vuk Cosic, a Slovenian artist, opened an anonymous e-mail. "Net-art" was first used a term to talk about online art and communications, thenstood for several things like: communications and graphics, e-mails, texts and images.

I decided to search some examlpes of net.art and in a way I feel like it's basically glitch art. There are similar traits between both, they have that "error" type of look, and have to do with numbers, letters, and files. However, net.art looks like an older version of glitch art. The article mentioned Olia Lialina's "My Boyfriend Came From The War" which we have seen in class, this is considered a more serious type of net.art and I actually like this artwork. It has so much thought into it, it narrates a story, and it has a meaning, which to me are elements of a great artwork.
