I am slightly familiar with the concept of Net.art due to my experiences on tumblr when I was in middle and early high school. I believe that using the concept of the Internet which has become widely popular within the last decade as a medium of art is very smart due to the prevalence of it in our lives. I think it is very interesting how early net.artists would use the aesthetic of hacking and coding, and it is still relevant to this day. Now, however, the theme of the black and green coding or the “error 404” is almost seen as more vintage nowadays which is fascinating considering how new the internet actually is. 

I love the motive behind many net.artists and how they utilize a lot of their work to create movements and their own manifestos to add their own deeper thought and concepts into their work. A very interesting artwork collective was the I/O/D that expanded the idea of software as culture to break the stereotypes of software developers.
