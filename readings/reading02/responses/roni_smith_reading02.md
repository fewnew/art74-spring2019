I've had a few experiences with glitch art. A friend in high school did some for his instagram page, and I've done something myself where i've manipulated an image with the text tool, a technique that Briz explains in his essay. Back then I only really considered the aesthetic qualities of these images, since these were posted on instagram -- a platform that's visual heavy and is made to be viewed quickly, rather than analyized. 

I found it interesting how Briz explained the politics surrounding glitch art. I know with apple products, like the iphone, we are unable to change the default applications unless we "jailbreak" them. Even this is complicated and involves a great deal of risk. Taking this risk and creating images on platforms that are not meant to do so is a kind of resistance in our digital age.
