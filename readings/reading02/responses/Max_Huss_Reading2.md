At first, I was a little unsure about the glitch art video. The site has a cool vibe when first opened, but I immediately started questioning the authenticity of the motivation behind the aesthetic presented. As he begins talking, Things hop around the screen, and his virtual essay in the small window center screen is chopped together in a someone “glitchy” way. Is this guy just some “glitch artist” who is presenting an aesthetic? Is he nothing more than those apps and filters that turn your pictures and text into glitchy images?

	As he kept talking, I came to my pinnacle of interest about ten minutes in. He was discussing how the misuse of technology to produce errors aren't errors at all; a computer is meant to behave a certain way, and we only ever use it for a little of what it can do. He discussed the differences between glitches, errors, and those glitch apps. But then as it got political, it was getting way too deep for my brain at 11 pm. This man is extremely intelligent; I never would have thought of Facebook as fascism or a PDF as some closed community that rejects plagiarism. I left the video both in wonder of this world that I knew nothing about, and a little confused about what beliefs I’m subscribing too based on my software choices!
