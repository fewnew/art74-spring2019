While I was watching “thoughts on glitch art” many things started to pop up on my head, a lot of curiosity because I didn’t see glitch art as art before, I always saw it as “ops I messed up” type of thing. As Nick progressed through the essay he explain what glitch art was as he stated that "glitch art is anytime an artist intentionally leverages that moment, by either recontextualizing or provoking glitches” and also suggested that to try and do this in our daily basis after waking up, try and use any app the way it wasn’t suppose to be used, not matter what software, Glitch is doing it wrong with intention, not accidental because if it was accidental it wasn’t glitch art. The way he went about glitch art made me think about it and give it a try but I hardly see myself giving it a chance, who knows maybe one day I actually find it interesting.

My personal opinion is that this type of art isn’t art, or at least the way i see it right now, some might feel like it is, but in my opinion art is a whole different world, art to me is showing your skills, makes you unique for something maybe others can’t do. I’ve never had a glitch when playing video games but Ive seen people glitch out and use that as an advantage and I clearly see that as cheating the game. I can’t claim art to a mistake or error that was intentionally made, because I love showing my skills and attributes in art, I like seen peoples reactions to what i am capable of and even though this is my personal opinion when it comes to glitches in video games, and I don’t relate to this but I can see why people get interested into this type of “art” its playing with software in a different type of way.
