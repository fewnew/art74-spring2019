It’s quite funny to actually listen to him talk about opening a file of .ppt, .docx,.mov,.jpeg, and what-not with a different application that wasn’t fit to support it. I’ve had many problems with this in the past, especially during the times that I didn’t know that Photoshop files weren’t fit to support with Illustrator and Lightroom files, as I thought since all three were associated with Adobe. I think it’s pretty cool to see that people are actually taking note of this type of art and making it fit to their own personal/aesthetic preferences, in such, just like “nostalgia”, “psychedelics”, and “exploring themes of failure”. What Nick says is also interesting as he says that glitch is not aesthetic but is rather an ‘ethic’.

I loved that Nick really made me think about another type of perspective when it came to glitch and bugs. I actually am really tempted to try out a few pictures and see what they will come up with when I change the text file. I’ve seen all these features before but never really knew exactly what I should do if I somehow added a bug in. I never knew that people would really configure this as art, since a lot of art critiques are out in the world not putting much faith into others for their art.
