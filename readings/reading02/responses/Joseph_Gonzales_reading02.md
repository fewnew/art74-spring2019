In reading 2 it went over what glitch art is and how it is used in society along with how to continue doing glitch art. Going into the class last week the professor taught about glich art and went over how we could make it. I was completely amazed by this new art form, Before the class i wasn't aware of glitch art and what it was. To be completely honest i thought glitch art was just a malfunction with technology and really didn't see much from it. From Nick Briz video it opened my perception on glitch art and showed how you can take something normal and distort it into your own reality or art. 
	One of the things i liked most from the video was how he went over defining what a Glitch is. Nick Briz went over what the dictionary says on glitches and proves how they are a untrue statement. I like Nicks definition on how he talks about a glitch being a instant error that it is a unexpected moment in a system that calls attention to that system. With the calling attention it is the glitch that pops up and the creation of the modification. I really liked how throughout the video essay it talks about turning the familiar into a unfamiliar. I feel that that statement doesnt just fit perfectly with glitch art but also with all art forms.
