I found this video presentation pretty interesting and I find glitch art
vey cool, although intimidating. The video plays like an ordinary guy just
vlogging on youtube, but because of all the special annotations and context he
can provide on his website it feels a lot cooler and deep. I do think the layout
could be shown in an easier spread to understand, but I think it definitely
leaves and impression as well as showing his capabilities in the medium and
a sense of humor.
Glitch art is very cool and mysterious for me. I love how it looks and it
really fascinates me how one can create something so beautiful by, as far as I
know, making mistakes. It is a really cool medium, but I am afraid to play around
with it. I am only a little computer-literate, but I don't know how they function
like the back of my hand. I would be too afraid of deleting, like, files which
keep the computer from exploding or something. MS Paint is the farthest I have
explored with digital art unfortunately.
