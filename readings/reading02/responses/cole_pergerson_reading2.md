I’ve always thought of glitch art as something you make in photoshop or on a phone app. I was shocked when Nick Briz described his process of making glitch art. He literary tried to create real glitches by misusing his software and files. I have never thought of using a software in a way it was not intended for and especially not for art. I always thought of a glitch as an error, however, Nick states that a glitch is an unexpected event that happens with the system because people are the ones who make errors.

What I found more interesting than the new definition I had was Nick’s motivation for making glitch art. For Nick, glitch art was an ethnic in which you challenge intended use of the software. By misusing the software, you may produce glitch art and discover a new perspective on the software. More importantly, when you create glitches, you are resisting the creator’s view on technology.
