I think it's interesting how he defines the word, "glitch" because we would assume that the machine or computer is doing something incorrectly, but it's doing what it's supposed to given its factors.
To us, it's unexpected and therefore a glitch is like an error in the system. It makes sense that different applications will process the "glitch" differently, especially if they're saved under different formats.
A PNG has transparency whereas a JPEG file does not; they are both image files but the glitch will affect them each uniquely and the same for different applications.
I have to agree with the definition of glitch art because we create art intentionally.
Though the outcome may be different from what we expected, as artists, we create art.
 I believe most of these glitch artists created these glitches by intentionally corrupting the date in files and trying to open them in different programs, resulting in unique glitches.
 Briz notes that using filters to create a glitch effect does not constitute as glitch art.
 While the effect is intentional, the result is not obtained through actually glitching media files.


According to the iPad trailer, "...technology is at its very best when it is invisible," I don't believe that's necessarily true.
technology is ubiquitous and most students will have laptops, tablets, phones. Contrary to what some adults would say, things like, "this generation is completely glued to their cellphones and other electronic devices"
as if it's our fault for wanting life to be a little less complex. I also think about which programs I would use on my phone and computer; I have different uses and convenience for it. On a side note Apple really did take a step in the wrong direction by offering upgrades for their products but capitalizing on profit, not few features
And the "new" features are just borrowed from other products and devices that aren't as popular.

I believe glitch art is about breaking and bending restrictions, not only to test your ability but the program's as well, like in the example with breaking Facebook's strict layout.
