The “Thoughts on Glitch” video had many different points and ideas when it came to glitch or glitches. I had already been exposed to this type of trend of creating “glitch art” and the reason I call it a trend and put quotes around it, is because I don’t consider it actual art. Glitch art, is a contemporary practice or trend, in my opinion, that like the video stated is not aesthetic. There is nothing pleasing about this type of art, yeah it could give it a psychedelic look which I do consider art a bit more, but there’s just something about data bending and corrupting a file that I don’t approve. Most contemporary art, to me, is lacking in skill, technique, and practice. It takes no effort to create something as simple as this or any other type of contemporary art.

Having stated my opinion on glitch art, I will also say that I do see glitch as an error, as a mistake and although it is done intentionally to create “art” I will continue to see it as wrong. However, there is one thing I did agree with on the video, that is when Nick Briz stated that glitch is an ethic, and how technology comes with instructions, but glitch artists reject those “right ways” to use technology in order to experiment. That mentality is something I agree with and am in favor of, experimenting when it comes to art is crucial and important.
