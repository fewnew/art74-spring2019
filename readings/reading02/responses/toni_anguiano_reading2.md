Thoughts on glitch Art by Nick Briz was interesting because, for one, I had never heard of glitch art before this verbal essay. The concept of glitch art is curious for someone who had never dabbled in this non-medium as Briz refers to it. It is a way to approach media by simply taking a digital photo and tampering with the code of the image to make something different and new. This is an intriguing concept. I also enjoyed the demonstration Briz included in the essay to help the audience understand not only what glitch art is, but also how to begin to dabble in it. His advice, perhaps for beginners, is to open a file in a software program not meant for said file and see what happens. Such as opening a digital image on a audio software to create a certain type of glitch art. I also enjoyed the brief history on where the word ‘glitch’ originated in the sixties.
I admire that he has done his research on glitches and actively finds new information and will change his opinions on what a glitch is or can be. The quote from Ellen Ullman’s book also resonated with me in the way that it is true what she says about computers. We are in an age where everything we do is done on computers, or with technology in general, whether it be homework, work, business or what have you, it is difficult to go anywhere or do anything without being connected to technology. I.e. with our cellphones or other devices. Briz mentions, “It is good to look at technology as less than tools and more like environments”, a reference of Marshall McLuhan’s ‘Medium is the Message’. 
Though obstacles can arise when creating glitch art and some softwares or technology will not allow it, it is an interesting way to approach media to bend or pull apart and be curious about. Lastly, I found Briz’s advice to simply attempt glitch art by trying to break the software quite humorous and he makes many great points.
