I really enjoyed watching the videos of Nick. These videos can help the class to understand how glitch art and programing works. 
As Nick told us there are two digital literacies which one of them is programming and glitch art. You can Glitch art by first 
making a copy file, then open a file application to work with it, then edit or save a file, and lastly open a application and 
do whatever you want.

Another interesting thing that Nick had taught us, he told us what glitch is and what is it equal to or what not it is equal to.
He mentioned first that a glitch is an unexpected moment in the system that calls attention to the system. Most important he 
taught us very important things like glitch doesn’t equal file, glitch art doesn’t equal glitch, glitch art doesn’t equal 
medium, glitch art is equal to an ethic. Nick told us that Glitch art is aestheticization of digital or analog errors, such as 
bugs either digital codes due by manipulating electronic devices which this is very important to the class because when the 
class uses a program we can find out when glitch art happens.
