     Something I found really interesting about this video is when Nick gave an example on the process of how glitch art is made 
  by just saving a photo and edititng the file number and text and also manipulating the data, this is also known as data bending
  This makes the image to glitch. Something elese that I found interesting is when Nick states that computers don't make mistakes, 
  people do and I wonder why that is?
  
    I've been seeing a lot of glitch art all around on social media but I never knew you could do it the way Nick explained. I've 
  also seen a lot of apps that also do glitch images but i would just consider those as filters.
