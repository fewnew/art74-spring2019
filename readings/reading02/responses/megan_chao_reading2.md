I really enjoyed watching Thoughts on Glitch [Art] v2.0. I was a form of art I never thought to execute, but the steps Nick was describing in how to glitch art seemed really interesting. I would genuinely try the steps in my free time. The interactive aspect of the website was one like I have never seen before and the nature of the video itself was very entertaining and fun to watch because of its interactive details. My first understanding of glitch art was something that was intentional on photo editing softwares such as Photoshop. I never knew that artists create glitch art through opening it on different programs. 
The most interesting part of the video, however, was not the process of creating glitch art, but rather the ethic and political views behind it. Opening applications for their non-intended purposes challenges the application as well as our own thought process of how technology consumes us. Nick made it clear how glitch art is not an aesthetic, even though many people think it is due to the rising trend of social media, but rather an ethic.
