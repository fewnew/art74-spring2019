Reading 2: Thoughts on Glitch art
	Coming into this essay I did not really know much about glitch art. I learned how glitch art is made and what defines glitch art. I like the idea of taking the familiar and introducing it to the unfamiliar and to be surprised by the results. I learned about data bending, which is a process where you take a file, open it in an application it would not normally be used in, saving that file, and opening it in its default application. I really enjoyed the part when the image of the cat was being altered through its text code. It made me realize that glitch art can be done by anyone as long as you have the programs used to alter it. 
	One of my favorite parts of the essay was when Nick Briz was explaining what glitch art is and is not. I think this clears up a lot of misconceptions that people may have about glitch art. Glitch art is the intentional manipulation that decontextualizes data. Glitch art needs to have an intention, otherwise it’s just a piece with a glitch aesthetic. I think another point that he made that stuck with me was when he was talking about the iPad. The iPad (and other products like it) are marketed to bring creativity and endless possibilities to the user. However there are a lot of restrictions to technology nowadays, like how the iPad has screws that prevent the user from tampering its insides or maybe apps created for these platforms have to follow a guideline. Briz’s essay was eye opening in the sense that technology can limit our creativity, and that there’s so much a program can do outside of its intentions to create art.
