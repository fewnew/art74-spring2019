getting on the website at first was kind of confusing, i thought we had the ability to scroll down so for a good minute or two i thought my website connection just bugged out. Turns out i was looking at the website entirely wrong. Playing the video at first was kind of startling since it did just pop out of nowhere but i guess that was intended. 
Throughout this presentation, i found it very interesting how easy glitch art can be produced. By taking something familiar and combining it with something unfamiliar. The only things that really stuck with me would have to be what glitch art is and isnt. Glitch art is not considered to be an error, nor is glitch art considered a glitch. It is however intentionally unexpected and is always done on purpose.
