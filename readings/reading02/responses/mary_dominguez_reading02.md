The video described the orgins of glitch art and further information involved with this practice, as well as the method of creating one. In this essay we explore the creativity behind glitch art, something that hold many defintions depending on how you use it. I find it fascinating that something that is formed from errors actually holds artistic, aesthetic, and even political values. It is definitly something that I want to explore more of.

One of the first things that I noticed about this video essay was how interactive it was. I really enjoyed the layout of the essay, not to mention that the images that would pop out was very cool. Overall, I thought that the interactive parts of the essay kept me very focused. I also love that the essay did not include any readings since a video captures my attention more, 
leaving me well-informed. One particular phrase that stook out to me was when he defines the process of making glitch art, stating "Take a familiar piece of technology and do something unfamiliar with it." I really liked this phrase because it forces you to experiment and try something new inorder to create something beautiful.
