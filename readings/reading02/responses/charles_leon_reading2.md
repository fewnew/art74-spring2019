The overall presentation of Thoughts On Glitch [Art]v2.0 was really fascinating to me and actually kept me attentive during the videos that were also being played. It really helped with coming to understand what Glitch Art is and what the process is like. While i didnâ€™t upload my own files to mess with I did try some of the processes (Editing a .jpeg in a text editor) on my own computer to the nice surprise of the results that occurred with them.

I think what struck me the most about the message being portrayed in the presentation was the idea of Glitch Art being more of an ethic rather than an aesthetic. I think it's understandable to have this type of view on Glitch Art. Nick advocates for digital literacy which in our contemporary world that is filled with technologies that we consume. Overall its a view that at least begins a conversation about how we use and allow softwares and technologies to be a part of our own lives and whether we view ourselves as the passive consumer or active users.
