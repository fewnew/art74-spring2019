I am not too familiar with the form of AR art, but reading through this article helped to explain more about the technicalities behind this form of new art. It helped me differ the difference between Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. I think it is really fascinating that it is a mixed reality, and in a way, could it be considered a mixed media since it is a form of two different types of mediums. Such as traditional mediums for example, graphite and charcoal together in an art piece would be consdered mixed, I would think that the overlaying of virtual world to an artist's chosen location of reality would also be mixed.

As someone who didn't know much about AR art, I assumed it would be more expensive to create art works of augmented reality. But I like how it is actually easily available for anyone such as mobile art. Since it is mentioned that AR has the ability to aesthetically manifest through many critical contemporary issues.
