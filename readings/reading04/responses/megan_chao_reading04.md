I think the concept of Augmented Reality is very interesting and how realistic it has gotten within the past few years is astonishing. When I typically think of Augmented Reality, generally I think of video games or the advertisements and videos that utilize AR in their marketing techniques. Reading about the works of several artists that use AR as their medium to get their messages across such as Tamiko Thiel and Mark Shwarek with their work on climate change or Papgiannisâ€™ work on insects. The medium to me is very interesting and would take a lot of dedication.

One aspect of Augmented Reality that I find very challenging is the incorporation of detail. When artists can incorporate minute details within a giant 3D world that the audience can actually interact with and view for themselves, I think that is very incredible. I hope AR within the next few years advances even further than it has now as we are able to see the positive changes it has brought us thus far.
