I think Pok√©mon Go is a great example of MR a mixed reality and it is coming more common in our daily life. Take Snapchat for example. I had hardly ever used the app but from what I know now, Snapchat contains filters for the front facing camera or the back-facing camera. It can project mixed reality onto the camera screen, like having an animation of your character singing or dancing, perhaps even flowers or snow falling. We see these filters used very commonly in social media to spruce up our pictures and content. 

Additionally, I've also seen AR artworks present in advertisements. One that I recall was an AR of someone's hair that would react to movement, particularly cars. 
The AR would make it so that the hair was being blown by the wind, which I thought was really fascinating. It kind of shows you that we are all connected and even the smallest of actions have cause-and-affect. Also, I remember seeing on the internet, there was a museum that had augmented realities and if the guest had a smartphone, they could scan the QR code and more information would pop up on the phone screen. When I saw it, I thought it was a really creative way to make learning more interactive and fun for the younger audiences. I think we've grown very accustomed to using augmented reality, in the form of QR codes with new devices and technology.
