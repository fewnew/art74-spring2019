Augmented Reality has always been a fascinating technology in its various application, but reading some of the examples of ARs use within the art space have been equally intriguing to me. My first experience with AR was with the Microsoft Hololens, while I had not used this technology personally viewing live demos of its uses were really exciting and something that really seemed to be coming to a more consumer market. It really excited me to see  how AR was going to be integrated into everyday life at the time, but it does seem like we are still some time away from that reality.

The works of Tamiko Thiel and Mark Shwarek interested me the most as their works pertaining to global phenomenons, especially their work on climate change. Being able to show an augmented place as it could appear. Presenting an idealized future where efforts are made to create more green energy sources or disaster burdened ones that are caused by continuing our polutionous ways.
