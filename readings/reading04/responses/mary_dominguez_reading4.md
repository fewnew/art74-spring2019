My first impression on the reading is that it helped informed me more about AR and how ar works, as well as exploring the concept of ar art. I knew what AR is previoulsy because I have seeen a couple of   ar Art spread around social media. I also remember it being a huge thing acouple of years back and always wondered how it worked. I wasn't very knowledgable about what AR was previously until i read about this article. What I do find intereting about this article was exploring AR artist and what their ideas consisted of it. I was really inspired by Tamikio Thiel aand Marl Skewarek's work. I really like how THiel's ideas consist of political aspcects and world problems that peopple should be more aware of. 

Before, I thought that Augmented Reality was very similar to virtual reality, however with VR, you are actually immersed inside a "virtual world." For augmented reality, only a portion of a part is virtual, merging both reality and virtual together. In today's genteration, AR is easily accessible through your phoen just by using apps. The popular messaging app SnapChat is a great example of AR by using face recognition to trigger filters. You can also always download apps specifically for AR projects such as Blippar.
