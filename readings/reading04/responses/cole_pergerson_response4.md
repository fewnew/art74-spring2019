    AR art is a form that requires the viewer to be present with a device that can decode a visual art piece. Digital screens allow AR art to perform in any space, but with geolocation, AR art can perform in specific places. AR Installation art requires both physical and virtual space to be considered. Everyone has a device that can view the art at anytime which allows the art to be anywhere.
    What I love with AR art is its ability to be placed anywhere. Pieces, such as the Jasmine Rain Birdcage, are lawless and can be placed in locations without consent. This opens up new ways of sending messages through digital screens. As a viewer, you can travel to locations and experience them through your eyes, but you can also experience them through the eyes of artists.
