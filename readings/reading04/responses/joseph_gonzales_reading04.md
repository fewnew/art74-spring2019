In reading 4 it talked about Augmented reality and it being an art form. Augmented reality is an interactive experience where the user is able to take the real world environment and create a virtual world through the lens of the mobile device. Augmented Reality is a fairly new art form due to technology, it relies on technology to help the artwork become visible. That virtual visibility gives the artist and the consumer a whole new relationship.  AR art is quite interesting because it allows the user to become apart of the art work and experience it in a whole new way. 
	What i thought was quite interesting is on how we kind of use Augmented reality almost everyday. With social media it makes AR such a normal thing when we apply filters that change or face or even when switching the camera around it can create a image or character that isn't really there. I think that it is really cool how artist are taking this Augmented reality and putting it in art museums. I feel like with apply AR art in museums it gives more of a drive for people to go out and attend.
