I learned a lot of things in the article that I read, for example, AR art. 
AR art is a form of artistic expression that complicates traditional notions of visual arts. 
AR art spans the arc of public and private presentation and performance of interaction and subversion, with AR art devices, 
they can act as a multisensory interface to augment the bodyâ€™s skin.

AR art complicates modern modes of sensibility and conceptions of aesthetic perception.
AR art coexists with invisibility, even with the physical space of the body. AR art is very important because it exhibits and 
its an exhibition of cultural expression.
