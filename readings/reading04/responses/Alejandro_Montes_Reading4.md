After reading this debate/article I finally understood the difference between Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. Whenever I heard either one of these terms, I always thought it was referring to the same thing. Now I know that VR is when you cut yourself off from the real world in order to experience a computer generated virtual world and AR involves overlaying a virtual world onto your view of the real world allowing you to experience both. Both are very interesting as they require technology, and it’s always nice to know and see how art develops with all technological advances. This to me is another controversial type of art which I believe requires a lot of skill, but I don’t think aesthetically is pleasing.

It is interesting to see all the ways people have made AR and VR work, through the use of smartphones, glasses, and wearables. Also all the things they’ve created like the AR dancing performance which combines, dance and performance to create this virtual artwork, it amazed me the most just finding out about it. Others include, AR in museums like creating overlays on already existing artworks and then extending that so if there were any places on the artwork the AR world would appear at the real life location. It’s also something we now live with everyday, with social media and Snapchat being quite famous, Snapchat provides us with many AR filters that we can use whenever and wherever. Technology just keeps amazing us in every way and artistically is one of those ways.
