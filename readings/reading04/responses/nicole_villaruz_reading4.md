AR is an art form that I have had no knowledge about, so this reading helped me learn a lot about the many forms and benefits of AR to society. I previously had not known about the differences between AR and VR. Virtual reality involves cutting yourself off from reality and immersing yourself in a virtual world. You are able to use AR as a way to raise awareness, make it touchable, and combine it with the performing arts. Devices such as the Google Glass are becoming a more integrated part of our lives.

Before this reading, all I knew about AR and VR were the virtual reality headsets used to transport the viewer into a different world. Learning that different art forms can be incorporated into augmented reality was interesting, such as using sculptures as another layer in terms of physical reality.
