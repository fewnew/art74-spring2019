AR art is very interesting, you are not emersing yourself fully into the virtual world like VR but bringing a virtual object into the real world. 
A good example I know of would be Pokemon Go, players can walk around and catch pokemon.
Snapchat is another example, there are different fliters that have little characters like dancing animals and users and move them around and place them where they like.
At most times it is easy too see AR you just need a device like a phone or a tablet, but many musuems are adapting to the the fast pace change.

The reading gave more information about AR art, the author included information about the difference between AR and VR. 
Virtual reality is being totally emersed into the virtual world while Augemented reality is bring a virtual object into the real world by using devices like a phone.
The reading brings up two different types of AR, Mobile AR and Geolocated AR. Geolocation AR requires the person to record the area before it is placed while Mobile AR is placed onto an image or object.
