Reading 4: Invisible Visualities: Augmented Reality Art and the Contemporary Media Ecology

	When it comes to virtual reality it defies traditional mediums. There isn’t a physical, tangible art piece, but that’s because they are known as an invisible visuality. There is a big difference between virtual reality and augmented reality. With virtual reality one is basically transporting themselves out of the real world and immersing themselves in an entirely different world. On the other hand augmented reality combines the real world and the virtual world together. An example of AR art would be when using a phone or monitor to scan over the physical world, but effects that would not normally be seen in reality would pop up on the screen. A common example of this would be Snapchat filters. It’s still your face on the screen, but little virtual effects are modifying your face and surroundings.
	AR art is emerging with the development of technology. Tamiko Thiel is a “pioneer” when it comes to 3D graphic worlds. One of Thiel’s newest works focuses on the global climate change. This series is known as Transformation. In this series if a viewer uses a phone on certain areas of the city it portrays urban life with a future sustainable environment. Thiel’s piece is one that shows the power of AR art. It speaks a powerful message of what the world around us can be through an art form that is naked to the invisible eye. AR art is giving the sense of seeing a new experience. With the space around us we can transform the ordinary into art.
