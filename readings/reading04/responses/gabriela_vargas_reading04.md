AR wasn't introduced to me until maybe 2015 when I was at Stoneridge mall in Pleasanton, CA when I went to get a new phone at the TMobile store. It wasn't until I passed the Microsoft store when I saw that there was a AR section that was settled there for customers to have a try at the new software. I saw a couple of people try it out as my dad was talking to the TMobile representative/employee. As soon as I got my know, I quickly researched some of the works that AR has been a part of and I instantly was so interested in it. I always had felt out of place not knowing what AR was for the longest time but since then, I've strived to get the chance to learn the tools to make my own AR world.

I'm so glad that AR is now becoming a bigger and better platform and interest to a lot of individuals in the world. I feel like it deserves a lot more attention as it can furthermore advance health classes. I've already seen a lot of medical students already using AR technology to help themselves practive surgeries and study body parts. I saw a view installation photos from Helen Papagiannis and I find it so interesting as well as how much craft was put into it. Hopefully one day, I get to experience AR myself by creating my own reality.
