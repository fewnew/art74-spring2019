The artist I chose to research a little more about is Joan Jones. I decided to focus on one of her pieces of work which is called, "Vertical Roll", which was filmed in 1972. The creation of this film was simply just a rescanned image from a monitor in which the vertical roll is continuously rolling out of the frame. It's supposed to deliberately interfere with the visual pleasure and aesthetic of watching a woman and her own body on camera. The effects that this film rubs off on audiences is that it is an "unstable" televisual signal that is something you could most likely see on a static-like screen on an old television. Joan Jonas has been using her body as an artform, and conducting this piece was a way to express herself to create a tension between the subject and the audience. The symbolism behind this is for the audience to view subjectivity and objectivity, explaining how Joan is showing her body through wearing a belly-dancer-like outfit and a masked-feathered headdress.<br>
An artist that I liked during the presentation was Aldo Tambelli, majorly because he focused on the color Black in a film called, "Black Is". I look forward to researching more about his pieces of work because of how creative he made the film, due to the fact that he's physically putting in the work by painting on the film that is projected. I also really enjoyed Bruce Nauman's pieces of work because I've always compelled myself to pieces with neon lights. Mainly due to their vibrant color but also withiin the use of electricity.
