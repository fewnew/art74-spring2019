  I choose to research Nancy Holt from the reading. Although she is more know for her sculpture work, Nancy did some video art in her early years. Nancy explored what it meant to really see something and used video to express this. In one of her works, called “Going Around in Circles,” Nancy experimented with perception and point of view. The most of the video is covered except for five holes where people are walking to and from. Even though you’re viewing one perspective, your attention is focused the five different holes so instead you see five different perspectives. 

  Although I was really intrigued by Nancy’s video art, I found her sculpture more interesting. She did a piece called Sun Tunnels which were concrete cylinders that were laid out in the middle of a desert. They’re aligned to the summer and winter solstice so they create some beautiful scenic shots with the sun. If you look through the cylinders, you’ll see what looks like a planet with stars around it. The planet you see is our home planet and it’s beautiful but we need to take care of it.
