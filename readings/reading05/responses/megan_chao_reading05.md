I decided to research Bruce Nauman for this article. The reading described his work “Stamping in the Studio” in which he literally moves around for 60 minutes in his area. I find that Nauman’s work often has a peaceful and mesmerizing atmosphere to them. The concept of “Stamping in the Studio” is to effect how the viewers view the art piece. It is described that the viewers often go from boredom to a relaxing feeling due to the repeating white noise of foot stomping. 

Because of the curiosity of “Stamping in the Studio”, I decided to research more of his work. I looked up his piece titled “Floor Wall Positions”. The video is an hour long of Nauman going into several different positions on the floor and wall for several seconds each as the name suggests. The concept of “Floor Wall Positions” is to demonstrate the usage of space and measurement with a tool most people do not use to measure, our bodies. All of his work is very profound and follow a similar relaxing, but at the same time, eerie feeling.
