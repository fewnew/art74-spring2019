Mass media quickly became a platform where women could voice their outrage of being treated like objects that men were completely in control of. This banded feminists together as they sought to change their position. In class we watched the video, "Semiotics of the Kitchen," by Martha Rosler. In this performance she is challenging gender roles through the portrayal of a woman standing in the kitchen as she holds various tools and utensils, including knives and lists their names in alphabetical order. She sets a very grim tone to the setting by using a loud voice, when the expected notion for woman is to have a soft, quiet voice with gentle hands and manners. She not only defies these stereotypes, but she also holds sharp objects violenting and in a stabbing motion, she conveys that women, like men, can be dominant and assertive. I really enjoyed watching this video because I understand what it feels like to be treated differently because of who I am as a person: my social standing, my race, heritage, and cultural background.    

Videos could not be mass produced in 1975 so it was difficult to sell, which is why I find Martha's piece all the more impressive. She had two demographic groups focused yet she also managed to convey layers of other topics such as politics, gender studies and psychology.
