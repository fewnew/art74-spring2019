i feel video art now in comparison to video art back then are really different. i think most people would consider or think of video art in terms of youtube for example creating videos for content. where as before, as we read, video art was very much used in a giant political aspect ie. personal situations of different women. i kind of lost track in reading this article as i did not find it very entertaining or interesting to be comlpetely honest. it was hard to pay attention to what i was reading. 

however with saying that, i will say that the pictures present in the article are very interesting. in terms of video art, there are very few people that i personally follow on social platforms such as instagram, where clips like these are similar. video art just makes me think of (if not creators from youtube) film students on instagram. or users such as @abluerdonjuan who document pieces of their lives for all to see, and not for political uses such as before. he has a very nostalgic feel to his films and theyre very minimalistic and real in terms of being and feeling very relatable.
