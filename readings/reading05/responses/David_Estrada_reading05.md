As part of the overview of video art and its history, I decided to focus my attention on American sculptor and video artist Lynda Benglis. Benglis is an artist from the 60s and 70s and while she’s most famous and well known for her sculptures and abstract art projects, she had also experimented with the medium of video and the creation of video art. She was part of minimalist artist group and movement and allowed her art to almost create themselves as she went on. 
The piece I’ve chosen to focus on from Benglis is “Collage”, created in 1973. In this video, Benglis experiments with video art and decides to create a piece that had no real narrative or meaning to it but instead created a confusing and abstract piece. Allowing the viewer to interpret their own meaning and message behind the video. The video has a close shot of Benglis eating an orange whole with the background displaying video and images of multiple oranges and a hockey game. Bright colors and rapid movements are presented with hardly any sound in the mix but slight feedback. Once again, having no narrative or message but to visually appeal the viewer rather than to inform them of something greater.
